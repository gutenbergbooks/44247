<p>The social spirit peculiar to the French nation
had already introduced into the inns of that country
the gay and cheerful character of welcome
upon which Erasmus, at a later period, dwells
with strong emphasis, as a contrast to the saturnine
and sullen reception which strangers were apt
to meet with at a German caravansera. Philipson
was, therefore, in expectation of being received by
the busy, civil, and talkative host&mdash;by the hostess
and her daughter, all softness, coquetry, and glee&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
smiling and supple waiter&mdash;the officious
and dimpled chambermaid. The better inns in
France boast also separate rooms, where strangers
could change or put in order their dress, where
they might sleep without company in their bedroom,
and where they could deposit their baggage
in privacy and safety. But all these luxuries
were as yet unknown in Germany; and in Alsace,
where the scene now lies, as well as in the other
dependencies of the Empire, they regarded as
effeminacy everything beyond such provisions as
were absolutely necessary for the supply of the
wants of travellers; and even these were coarse
and indifferent, and, excepting in the article of
wine, sparingly ministered.</p>

<p>The Englishman, finding that no one appeared
at the gate, began to make his presence known by
calling aloud, and finally by alighting, and smiting
with all his might on the doors of the hostelry for
a long time, without attracting the least attention.
At length the head of a grizzled servitor was
thrust out at a small window, who, in a voice
which sounded like that of one displeased at
the interruption, rather than hopeful of advantage
from the arrival of a guest, demanded what he
wanted.</p>

<p>"Is this an inn?" replied Philipson.</p>

<p>"Yes," bluntly replied the domestic, and was
about to withdraw from the window, when the
traveller added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And if it be, can I have lodgings?"</p>

<p>"You may come in," was the short and dry
answer.</p>

<p>"Send some one to take the horses," replied
Philipson.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>

<p>"No one is at leisure," replied this most repulsive
of waiters; "you must litter down your horses
yourself, in the way that likes you best."</p>

<p>"Where is the stable?" said the merchant,
whose prudence and temper were scarce proof
against this Dutch phlegm.</p>

<p>The fellow, who seemed as sparing of his words
as if, like the Princess in the fairy tale, he had
dropped ducats with each of them, only pointed to
a door in an outer building, more resembling that
of a cellar than of a stable, and, as if weary of the
conference, drew in his head, and shut the window
sharply against the guest, as he would against an
importunate beggar.</p>

<p>Cursing the spirit of independence which left
a traveller to his own resources and exertions,
Philipson, making a virtue of necessity, led the
two nags towards the door pointed out as that of
the stable, and was rejoiced at heart to see light
glimmering through its chinks. He entered with
his charge into a place very like the dungeon vault
of an ancient castle, rudely fitted up with some
racks and mangers. It was of considerable extent
in point of length, and at the lower end two or
three persons were engaged in tying up their
horses, dressing them, and dispensing them their
provender.</p>

<p>This last article was delivered by the ostler, a
very old lame man, who neither put his hand to
wisp or curry-comb, but sat weighing forth hay by
the pound, and counting out corn, as it seemed, by
the grain, so anxiously did he bend over his task,
by the aid of a blinking light enclosed within a
horn lantern. He did not even turn his head at
the noise which the Englishman made on entering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
the place with two additional horses, far less did
he seem disposed to give himself the least trouble,
or the stranger the smallest assistance.</p>

<p>In respect of cleanliness, the stable of Augeas
bore no small resemblance to that of this Alsatian
<i>dorf</i>, and it would have been an exploit worthy of
Hercules to have restored it to such a state of
cleanliness as would have made it barely decent in
the eyes, and tolerable to the nostrils, of the punctilious
Englishman. But this was a matter which
disgusted Philipson himself much more than those
of his party which were principally concerned.
They, <i>videlicet</i> the two horses, seeming perfectly to
understand that the rule of the place was "first come
first served," hastened to occupy the empty stalls
which happened to be nearest to them. In this one
of them at least was disappointed, being received by
a groom with a blow across the face with a switch.</p>

<p>"Take that," said the fellow, "for forcing thyself
into the place taken up for the horses of the
Baron of Randelsheim."</p>

<p>Never in the course of his life had the English
merchant more pain to retain possession of his
temper than at that moment. Reflecting, however,
on the discredit of quarrelling with such a
man in such a cause, he contented himself with
placing the animal, thus repulsed from the stall
he had chosen, into one next to that of his companion,
to which no one seemed to lay claim.</p>

<p>The merchant then proceeded, notwithstanding
the fatigue of the day, to pay all that attention to
the mute companions of his journey which they
deserve from every traveller who has any share
of prudence, to say nothing of humanity. The
unusual degree of trouble which Philipson took to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
arrange his horses, although his dress, and much
more his demeanour, seemed to place him above
this species of servile labour, appeared to make an
impression even upon the iron insensibility of the
old ostler himself. He showed some alacrity in
furnishing the traveller, who knew the business
of a groom so well, with corn, straw, and hay,
though in small quantity, and at exorbitant rates,
which were instantly to be paid; nay, he even
went as far as the door of the stable, that he might
point across the court to the well, from which
Philipson was obliged to fetch water with his own
hands. The duties of the stable being finished,
the merchant concluded that he had gained such
an interest with the grim master of the horse, as
to learn of him whether he might leave his bales
safely in the stable.</p>

<p>"You may leave them if you will," said the
ostler; "but touching their safety, you will do
much more wisely if you take them with you, and
give no temptation to any one by suffering them to
pass from under your own eyes."</p>

<p>So saying, the man of oats closed his oracular
jaws, nor could he be prevailed upon to unlock
them again by any inquiry which his customer
could devise.</p>

<p>In the course of this cold and comfortless reception,
Philipson recollected the necessity of supporting
the character of a prudent and wary trader,
which he had forgotten once before in the course of
the day; and, imitating what he saw the others do,
who had been, like himself, engaged in taking
charge of their horses, he took up his baggage,
and removed himself and his property to the inn.
Here he was suffered to enter, rather than admitted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
into the general or public <i>stube</i>, or room of entertainment,
which, like the ark of the patriarch,
received all ranks without distinction, whether
clean or unclean.</p>

<p>The <i>stube</i>, or stove, of a German inn, derived its
name from the great hypocaust, which is always
strongly heated to secure the warmth of the apartment
in which it is placed. There travellers of
every age and description assembled&mdash;there their
upper garments were indiscriminately hung up
around the stove to dry or to air&mdash;and the guests
themselves were seen employed in various acts
of ablution or personal arrangement, which are
generally, in modern times, referred to the privacy
of the dressing-room.</p>

<p>The more refined feelings of the Englishman
were disgusted with this scene, and he was reluctant
to mingle in it. For this reason he inquired
for the private retreat of the landlord himself,
trusting that, by some of the arguments powerful
among his tribe, he might obtain separate quarters
from the crowd, and a morsel of food, to be eaten
in private. A grey-haired Ganymede, to whom he
put the question where the landlord was, indicated
a recess behind the huge stove, where, veiling
his glory in a very dark and extremely hot
corner, it pleased the great man to obscure himself
from vulgar gaze. There was something remarkable
about this person. Short, stout, bandylegged,
and consequential, he was in these respects like
many brethren of the profession in all countries.
But the countenance of the man, and still more his
manners, differed more from the merry host of
France or England than even the experienced
Philipson was prepared to expect. He knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
German customs too well to expect the suppliant
and serviceable qualities of the master of a French
inn, or even the more blunt and frank manners of
an English landlord. But such German innkeepers
as he had yet seen, though indeed arbitrary and
peremptory in their country fashions, yet, being
humoured in these, they, like tyrants in their
hours of relaxation, dealt kindly with the guests
over whom their sway extended, and mitigated, by
jest and jollity, the harshness of their absolute
power. But this man's brow was like a tragic
volume, in which you were as unlikely to find
anything of jest or amusement, as in a hermit's
breviary. His answers were short, sudden, and
repulsive, and the air and manner with which they
were delivered was as surly as their tenor; which
will appear from the following dialogue betwixt
him and his guest:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good host," said Philipson, in the mildest
tone he could assume, "I am fatigued, and far
from well&mdash;May I request to have a separate
apartment, a cup of wine, and a morsel of food, in
my private chamber?"</p>

<p>"You may," answered the landlord; but with a
look strangely at variance with the apparent acquiescence
which his words naturally implied.</p>

<p>"Let me have such accommodation, then, with
your earliest convenience."</p>

<p>"Soft!" replied the innkeeper. "I have said
that you may request these things, but not that I
would grant them. If you would insist on being
served differently from others, it must be at another
inn than mine."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the traveller, "I will shift
without supper for a night&mdash;nay, more, I will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
content to pay for a supper which I do not eat, if
you will cause me to be accommodated with a
private apartment."</p>

<p>"Seignor traveller," said the innkeeper, "every
one here must be accommodated as well as you,
since all pay alike. Whoso comes to this house
of entertainment must eat as others eat, drink as
others drink, sit at table with the rest of my
guests, and go to bed when the company have done
drinking."</p>

<p>"All this," said Philipson, humbling himself
where anger would have been ridiculous, "is highly
reasonable; and I do not oppose myself to your
laws or customs. But," added he, taking his
purse from his girdle, "sickness craves some privilege;
and when the patient is willing to pay for
it, methinks the rigour of your laws may admit of
some mitigation?"</p>

<p>"I keep an inn, Seignor, and not a hospital. If
you remain here, you shall be served with the
same attention as others,&mdash;if you are not willing
to do as others do, leave my house and seek another
inn."</p>

<p>On receiving this decisive rebuff, Philipson gave
up the contest, and retired from the <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>
of his ungracious host, to await the arrival
of supper, penned up like a bullock in a pound,
amongst the crowded inhabitants of the <i>stube</i>.
Some of these, exhausted by fatigue, snored away
the interval between their own arrival and that
of the expected repast; others conversed together
on the news of the country, and others again played
at dice, or such games as might serve to consume
the time. The company were of various ranks,
from those who were apparently wealthy and well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
appointed, to some whose garments and manners
indicated that they were but just beyond the grasp
of poverty.</p>

<p>A begging friar, a man apparently of a gay and
pleasant temper, approached Philipson, and engaged
him in conversation. The Englishman was
well enough acquainted with the world to be
aware, that whatever of his character and purpose
it was desirable to conceal would be best hidden
under a sociable and open demeanour. He, therefore,
received the friar's approaches graciously,
and conversed with him upon the state of Lorraine,
and the interest which the Duke of Burgundy's
attempt to seize that fief into his own hands was
likely to create both in France and Germany. On
these subjects, satisfied with hearing his fellow-traveller's
sentiments, Philipson expressed no
opinion of his own, but, after receiving such intelligence
as the friar chose to communicate, preferred
rather to talk upon the geography of the country,
the facilities afforded to commerce, and the rules
which obstructed or favoured trade.</p>

<p>While he was thus engaged in the conversation
which seemed most to belong to his profession, the
landlord suddenly entered the room, and, mounting
on the head of an old barrel, glanced his eye
slowly and steadily round the crowded apartment,
and when he had completed his survey, pronounced,
in a decisive tone, the double command,&mdash;"Shut
the gates! Spread the table!"</p>

<p>"The Baron St. Antonio be praised!" said the
friar. "Our landlord has given up hope of any
more guests to-night, until which blessed time we
might have starved for want of food before he had
relieved us. Ay, here comes the cloth. The old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
gates of the courtyard are now bolted fast enough;
and when Johann Mengs has once said, 'Shut the
gates,' the stranger may knock on the outside as
he will, but we may rest assured that it shall not
be opened to him."</p>

<p>"Meinherr Mengs maintains strict discipline in
his house," said the Englishman.</p>

<p>"As absolute as the Duke of Burgundy," answered
the friar. "After ten o'clock, no admittance&mdash;the
'seek another inn,' which is before
that a conditional hint, becomes, after the clock
has struck, and the watchmen have begun their
rounds, an absolute order of exclusion. He that is
without remains without, and he that is within must,
in like manner, continue there until the gates open
at break of day. Till then the house is almost like
a beleaguered citadel, John Mengs its seneschal"&mdash;</p>

<p>"And we its captives, good father," said Philipson.
"Well, content am I. A wise traveller
must submit to the control of the leaders of the
people when he travels; and I hope a goodly fat
potentate, like John Mengs, will be as clement as
his station and dignity admit of."</p>

<p>While they were talking in this manner, the
aged waiter, with many a weary sigh and many a
groan, had drawn out certain boards, by which a
table that stood in the midst of the <i>stube</i> had the
capacity of being extended, so as to contain the
company present, and covered it with a cloth,
which was neither distinguished by extreme
cleanliness nor fineness of texture. On this table,
when it had been accommodated to receive the
necessary number of guests, a wooden trencher and
spoon, together with a glass drinking-cup, were
placed before each, he being expected to serve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
himself with his own knife for the other purposes
of the table. As for forks, they were unknown
until a much later period, all the Europeans of
that day making the same use of the fingers to
select their morsels and transport them to the
mouth which the Asiatics now practise.</p>

<p>The board was no sooner arranged than the hungry
guests hastened to occupy their seats around
it; for which purpose the sleepers were awakened,
the dicers resigned their game, and the idlers and
politicians broke off their sage debates, in order to
secure their station at the supper-table, and be
ready to perform their part in the interesting
solemnity which seemed about to take place. But
there is much between the cup and the lip, and
not less sometimes between the covering of a table
and the placing food upon it. The guests sat in
order, each with his knife drawn, already menacing
the victuals which were still subject to the
operations of the cook. They had waited, with
various degrees of patience, for full half an hour,
when at length the old attendant before mentioned
entered with a pitcher of thin Moselle wine, so
light and so sharp-tasted that Philipson put down
his cup with every tooth in his head set on edge
by the slender portion which he had swallowed.
The landlord, John Mengs, who had assumed a
seat somewhat elevated at the head of the table,
did not omit to observe this mark of insubordination,
and to animadvert upon it.</p>

<p>"The wine likes you not, I think, my master?"
said he to the English merchant.</p>

<p>"For wine, no," answered Philipson; "but could
I see anything requiring such sauce, I have seldom
seen better vinegar."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p>This jest, though uttered in the most calm and
composed manner, seemed to drive the innkeeper
to fury.</p>

<p>"Who are you," he exclaimed, "for a foreign
pedlar, that ventures to quarrel with my wine,
which has been approved of by so many princes,
dukes, reigning dukes, graves, rhinegraves, counts,
barons, and knights of the Empire, whose shoes
you are altogether unworthy even to clean? Was
it not of this wine that the Count Palatine of
Nimmersatt drank six quarts before he ever rose
from the blessed chair in which I now sit?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it not, mine host," said Philipson;
"nor should I think of scandalising the sobriety of
your honourable guest, even if he had drunken
twice the quantity."</p>

<p>"Silence, thou malicious railer!" said the host;
"and let instant apology be made to me, and the
wine which you have calumniated, or I will
instantly command the supper to be postponed till
midnight."</p>

<p>Here there was a general alarm among the
guests, all abjuring any part in the censures of
Philipson, and most of them proposing that John
Mengs should avenge himself on the actual culprit
by turning him instantly out of doors, rather than
involve so many innocent and famished persons in
the consequences of his guilt. The wine they
pronounced excellent; some two or three even
drank their glass out, to make their words good;
and they all offered, if not with lives and fortunes,
at least with hands and feet, to support the ban of
the house against the contumacious Englishman.
While petition and remonstrance were assailing
John Mengs on every side, the friar, like a wise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
counsellor and a trusty friend, endeavoured to end
the feud by advising Philipson to submit to the
host's sovereignty.</p>

<p>"Humble thyself, my son," he said; "bend the
stubbornness of thy heart before the great lord of
the spigot and butt. I speak for the sake of others
as well as my own; for Heaven alone knows how
much longer they or I can endure this extenuating
fast!"</p>

<p>"Worthy guests," said Philipson, "I am grieved
to have offended our respected host, and am so far
from objecting to the wine that I will pay for a
double flagon of it, to be served all round to this
honourable company&mdash;so, only, they do not ask
me to share of it."</p>

<p>These last words were spoken aside; but the
Englishman could not fail to perceive, from the
wry mouths of some of the party who were possessed
of a nicer palate, that they were as much
afraid as himself of a repetition of the acid
potation.</p>

<p>The friar next addressed the company with a
proposal that the foreign merchant, instead of
being amerced in a measure of the liquor which
he had scandalised, should be mulcted in an equal
quantity of the more generous wines which were
usually produced after the repast had been concluded.
In this mine host, as well as the guests,
found their advantage; and, as Philipson made no
objection, the proposal was unanimously adopted,
and John Mengs gave, from his seat of dignity,
the signal for supper to be served.</p>

<p>The long-expected meal appeared, and there was
twice as much time employed in consuming as
there had been in expecting it. The articles of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
which the supper consisted, as well as the mode of
serving them up, were as much calculated to try
the patience of the company as the delay which
had preceded its appearance. Messes of broth and
vegetables followed in succession, with platters of
meat sodden and roasted, of which each in its turn
took a formal course around the ample table, and
was specially subjected to every one in rotation.
Black-puddings, hung beef, dried fish, also made
the circuit, with various condiments, called
botargo, caviare, and similar names, composed of
the roes of fish mixed with spices, and the like
preparations, calculated to awaken thirst and
encourage deep drinking. Flagons of wine accompanied
these stimulating dainties. The liquor
was so superior in flavour and strength to the ordinary
wine which had awakened so much controversy,
that it might be objected to on the opposite
account, being so heady, fiery, and strong, that,
in spite of the rebuffs which his criticism had
already procured, Philipson ventured to ask for
some cold water to allay it.</p>

<p>"You are too difficult to please, sir guest,"
replied the landlord, again bending upon the
Englishman a stern and offended brow; "if you
find the wine too strong in my house, the secret to
allay its strength is to drink the less. It is indifferent
to us whether you drink or not, so you
pay the reckoning of those good fellows who do."
And he laughed a gruff laugh.</p>

<p>Philipson was about to reply, but the friar,
retaining his character of mediator, plucked him
by the cloak, and entreated him to forbear. "You
do not understand the ways of the place," said he;
"it is not here as in the hostelries of England and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
France, where each guest calls for what he desires
for his own use, and where he pays for what he
has required, and for no more. Here we proceed
on a broad principle of equality and fraternity.
No one asks for anything in particular; but such
provisions as the host thinks sufficient are set
down before all indiscriminately; and as with the
feast, so is it with the reckoning. All pay their
proportions alike, without reference to the quantity
of wine which one may have swallowed more
than another; and thus the sick and infirm, nay,
the female and the child, pay the same as the
hungry peasant and strolling <i>lanzknecht</i>."</p>

<p>"It seems an unequal custom," said Philipson;
"but travellers are not to judge. So that when a
reckoning is called, every one, I am to understand,
pays alike?"</p>

<p>"Such is the rule," said the friar,&mdash;"excepting,
perhaps, some poor brother of our own order, whom
Our Lady and St. Francis send into such a scene
as this, that good Christians may bestow their
alms upon him, and so make a step on their road
to Heaven."</p>

<p>The first words of this speech were spoken in
the open and independent tone in which the friar
had begun the conversation; the last sentence died
away into the professional whine of mendicity
proper to the convent, and at once apprised Philipson
at what price he was to pay for the friar's
counsel and mediation. Having thus explained
the custom of the country, good Father Gratian
turned to illustrate it by his example, and, having
no objection to the new service of wine on account
of its strength, he seemed well disposed to signalise
himself amongst some stout topers, who, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
drinking deeply, appeared determined to have full
pennyworths for their share of the reckoning.
The good wine gradually did its office, and even
the host relaxed his sullen and grim features, and
smiled to see the kindling flame of hilarity catch
from one to another, and at length embrace almost
all the numerous guests at the table d'hôte, except
a few who were too temperate to partake deeply of
the wine, or too fastidious to enter into the discussions
to which it gave rise. On these the host
cast, from time to time, a sullen and displeased
eye.</p>

<p>Philipson, who was reserved and silent, both in
consequence of his abstinence from the wine-pot
and his unwillingness to mix in conversation with
strangers, was looked upon by the landlord as a
defaulter in both particulars; and as he aroused
his own sluggish nature with the fiery wine,
Mengs began to throw out obscure hints about
kill-joy, mar-company, spoil-sport, and such like
epithets, which were plainly directed against the
Englishman. Philipson replied, with the utmost
equanimity, that he was perfectly sensible that
his spirits did not at this moment render him
an agreeable member of a merry company, and
that with the leave of those present he would
withdraw to his sleeping-apartment, and wish
them all a good evening, and continuance to their
mirth.</p>

<p>But this very reasonable proposal, as it might
have elsewhere seemed, contained in it treason
against the laws of German compotation.</p>

<p>"Who are you," said John Mengs, "who presume
to leave the table before the reckoning is
called and settled? Sapperment der teufel! we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
are not men upon whom such an offence is to be
put with impunity! You may exhibit your polite
pranks in Rams-Alley if you will, or in Eastcheap,
or in Smithfield; but it shall not be in John
Mengs's Golden Fleece, nor will I suffer one guest
to go to bed to blink out of the reckoning, and so
cheat me and all the rest of my company."</p>

<p>Philipson looked round, to gather the sentiments
of the company, but saw no encouragement to
appeal to their judgment. Indeed, many of them
had little judgment left to appeal to, and those
who paid any attention to the matter at all were
some quiet old soakers, who were already beginning
to think of the reckoning, and were disposed to
agree with the host in considering the English
merchant as a flincher, who was determined to
evade payment of what might be drunk after he
left the room; so that John Mengs received the
applause of the whole company, when he concluded
his triumphant denunciation against Philipson.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, you may withdraw if you please;
but, poz element! it shall not be for this time to
seek for another inn, but to the courtyard shall
you go, and no farther, there to make your bed
upon the stable litter; and good enough for the
man that will needs be the first to break up good
company."</p>

<p>"It is well said, my jovial host," said a rich
trader from Ratisbon; "and here are some six of
us&mdash;more or less&mdash;who will stand by you to
maintain the good old customs of Germany; and
the&mdash;umph&mdash;laudable and&mdash;and praiseworthy
rules of the Golden Fleece."</p>

<p>"Nay, be not angry, sir," said Philipson; "yourself
and your three companions, whom the good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
wine has multiplied into six, shall have your own
way of ordering the matter; and since you will
not permit me to go to bed, I trust that you will
take no offence if I fall asleep in my chair."</p>

<p>"How say you? what think you, mine host?"
said the citizen from Ratisbon; "may the gentleman,
being drunk, as you see he is, since he cannot
tell that three and one make six&mdash;I say, may
he, being drunk, sleep in the elbow-chair?"</p>

<p>This question introduced a contradiction on the
part of the host, who contended that three and one
made four, not six; and this again produced a
retort from the Ratisbon trader. Other clamours
rose at the same time, and were at length with
difficulty silenced by the stanzas of a chorus song
of mirth and good fellowship, which the friar,
now become somewhat oblivious of the rule of St.
Francis, thundered forth with better good-will
than he ever sang a canticle of King David.
Under cover of this tumult, Philipson drew himself
a little aside, and though he felt it impossible
to sleep, as he had proposed, was yet enabled to
escape the reproachful glances with which John
Mengs distinguished all those who did not call
for wine loudly, and drink it lustily. His thoughts
roamed far from the <i>stube</i> of the Golden Fleece,
and upon matter very different from that which
was discussed around him, when his attention was
suddenly recalled by a loud and continued knocking
on the door of the hostelry.</p>

<p>"What have we here?" said John Mengs, his
nose reddening with very indignation; "who the
foul fiend presses on the Golden Fleece at such an
hour, as if he thundered at the door of a bordel?
To the turret window some one&mdash;Geoffrey, knave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
ostler, or thou, old Timothy, tell the rash man
there is no admittance into the Golden Fleece save
at timeous hours."</p>

<p>The men went as they were directed, and might
be heard in the <i>stube</i> vying with each other in the
positive denial which they gave to the ill-fated
guest who was pressing for admission. They
returned, however, to inform their master, that
they were unable to overcome the obstinacy of the
stranger, who refused positively to depart until he
had an interview with Mengs himself.</p>

<p>Wroth was the master of the Golden Fleece at
this ill-omened pertinacity, and his indignation
extended, like a fiery exhalation, from his nose,
all over the adjacent regions of his cheeks and
brow. He started from his chair, grasped in his
hand a stout stick, which seemed his ordinary
sceptre or leading staff of command, and muttering
something concerning cudgels for the shoulders of
fools, and pitchers of fair or foul water for the
drenching of their ears, he marched off to the window
which looked into the court, and left his
guests nodding, winking, and whispering to each
other, in full expectation of hearing the active
demonstrations of his wrath. It happened otherwise,
however; for, after the exchange of a few
indistinct words, they were astonished when they
heard the noise of the unbolting and unbarring of
the gates of the inn, and presently after the footsteps
of men upon the stairs; and the landlord
entering, with an appearance of clumsy courtesy,
prayed those assembled to make room for an
honoured guest, who came, though late, to add
to their numbers. A tall dark form followed,
muffled in a travelling-cloak; on laying aside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
which, Philipson at once recognised his late fellow-traveller,
the Black Priest of St. Paul's.</p>

<p>There was in the circumstance itself nothing at
all surprising, since it was natural that a landlord,
however coarse and insolent to ordinary
guests, might yet show deference to an ecclesiastic,
whether from his rank in the Church or from his
reputation for sanctity. But what did appear surprising
to Philipson was the effect produced by the
entrance of this unexpected guest. He seated himself,
without hesitation, at the highest place of
the board, from which John Mengs had dethroned
the aforesaid trader from Ratisbon, notwithstanding
his zeal for ancient German customs, his steady
adherence and loyalty to the Golden Fleece, and
his propensity to brimming goblets. The priest
took instant and unscrupulous possession of his
seat of honour, after some negligent reply to the
host's unwonted courtesy; when it seemed that
the effect of his long black vestments, in place of
the slashed and flounced coat of his predecessor,
as well as of the cold grey eye with which he
slowly reviewed the company, in some degree
resembled that of the fabulous Gorgon, and if it
did not literally convert those who looked upon it
into stone, there was yet something petrifying in
the steady unmoved glance with which he seemed
to survey them, looking as if desirous of reading
their very inmost souls, and passing from one to
another, as if each upon whom he looked in succession
was unworthy of longer consideration.</p>

<p>Philipson felt, in his turn, that momentary
examination, in which, however, there mingled
nothing that seemed to convey recognition. All
the courage and composure of the Englishman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
could not prevent an unpleasant feeling while
under this mysterious man's eye, so that he felt a
relief when it passed from him and rested upon
another of the company, who seemed in turn to
acknowledge the chilling effects of that freezing
glance. The noise of intoxicated mirth and drunken
disputation, the clamorous argument, and the still
more boisterous laugh, which had been suspended
on the priest's entering the eating-apartment,
now, after one or two vain attempts to resume
them, died away, as if the feast had been changed
to a funeral, and the jovial guests had been at once
converted into the lugubrious mutes who attend
on such solemnities. One little rosy-faced man,
who afterwards proved to be a tailor from Augsburg,
ambitious, perhaps, of showing a degree of
courage not usually supposed consistent with his
effeminate trade, made a bold effort; and yet it
was with a timid and restrained voice that he
called on the jovial friar to renew his song. But
whether it was that he did not dare to venture on
an uncanonical pastime in presence of a brother
in orders, or whether he had some other reason for
declining the invitation, the merry churchman
hung his head, and shook it with such an expressive
air of melancholy, that the tailor drew back
as if he had been detected in cabbaging from a
cardinal's robes, or cribbing the lace of some cope
or altar gown. In short, the revel was hushed
into deep silence, and so attentive were the company
to what should arrive next, that the bells of
the village church, striking the first hour after
midnight, made the guests start as if they heard
them rung backwards, to announce an assault or
conflagration. The Black Priest, who had taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
some slight and hasty repast, which the host had
made no kind of objection to supplying him with,
seemed to think the bells, which announced the
service of lauds, being the first after midnight, a
proper signal for breaking up the party.</p>

<p>"We have eaten," he said, "that we may support
life, let us pray that we may be fit to meet
death; which waits upon life as surely as night
upon day, or the shadow upon the sunbeam, though
we know not when or from whence it is to come
upon us."</p>

<p>The company, as if mechanically, bent their
uncovered heads, while the priest said, with his
deep and solemn voice, a Latin prayer, expressing
thanks to God for protection throughout the day,
and entreating for its continuance during the
witching hours which were to pass ere the day
again commenced. The hearers bowed their heads
in token of acquiescence in the holy petition; and,
when they raised them, the Black Priest of St.
Paul's had followed the host out of the apartment,
probably to that which was destined for his repose.
His absence was no sooner perceived than signs,
and nods, and even whispers were exchanged
between the guests; but no one spoke above his
breath, or in such connected manner, as that
Philipson could understand anything distinctly
from them. He himself ventured to ask the friar,
who sat near him, observing at the same time the
under-tone which seemed to be fashionable for the
moment, whether the worthy ecclesiastic who had
left them was not the Priest of St. Paul's, on the
frontier town of La Ferette.</p>

<p>"And if you know it is he," said the friar, with
a countenance and a tone from which all signs of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
intoxication were suddenly banished, "why do you
ask of me?"</p>

<p>"Because," said the merchant, "I would willingly
learn the spell which so suddenly converted
so many merry tipplers into men of sober manners,
and a jovial company into a convent of Carthusian
friars?"</p>

<p>"Friend," said the friar, "thy discourse savoureth
mightily of asking after what thou knowest
right well. But I am no such silly duck as to be
taken by a decoy. If thou knowest the Black
Priest, thou canst not be ignorant of the terrors
which attend his presence, and that it were safer
to pass a broad jest in the holy House of Loretto
than where he shows himself."</p>

<p>So saying, and as if desirous of avoiding further
discourse, he withdrew to a distance from
Philipson.</p>

<p>At the same moment the landlord again appeared,
and, with more of the usual manners of a
publican than he had hitherto exhibited, commanded
his waiter, Geoffrey, to hand round to the
company a sleeping-drink, or pillow-cup of distilled
water, mingled with spices, which was indeed
as good as Philipson himself had ever tasted.
John Mengs, in the meanwhile, with somewhat of
more deference, expressed to his guests a hope that
his entertainment had given satisfaction; but this
was in so careless a manner, and he seemed so
conscious of deserving the affirmative which was
expressed on all hands, that it became obvious
there was very little humility in proposing the
question. The old man, Timothy, was in the
meantime mustering the guests, and marking with
chalk on the bottom of a trencher the reckoning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
the particulars of which were indicated by certain
conventional hieroglyphics, while he showed on
another the division of the sum total among the
company, and proceeded to collect an equal share
of it from each. When the fatal trencher, in
which each man paid down his money, approached
the jolly friar, his countenance seemed to be somewhat
changed. He cast a piteous look towards
Philipson, as the person from whom he had the
most hope of relief; and our merchant, though displeased
with the manner in which he had held
back from his confidence, yet not unwilling in
a strange country to incur a little expense, in the
hope of making a useful acquaintance, discharged
the mendicant's score as well as his own. The
poor friar paid his thanks in many a blessing in
good German and bad Latin, but the host cut them
short; for, approaching Philipson with a candle in
his hand, he offered his own services to show him
where he might sleep, and even had the condescension
to carry his mail, or portmanteau, with
his own landlordly hands.</p>

<p>"You take too much trouble, mine host," said
the merchant, somewhat surprised at the change
in the manner of John Mengs, who had hitherto
contradicted him at every word.</p>

<p>"I cannot take too much pains for a guest," was
the reply, "whom my venerable friend, the Priest
of St. Paul's, hath especially recommended to my
charge."</p>

<p>He then opened the door of a small bedroom,
prepared for the occupation of a guest, and said
to Philipson,&mdash;"Here you may rest till to-morrow
at what hour you will, and for as many days more
as you incline. The key will secure your wares
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
against theft or pillage of any kind. I do not this
for every one; for, if my guests were every one to
have a bed to himself, the next thing they would
demand might be a separate table; and then there
would be an end of the good old German customs,
and we should be as foppish and frivolous as our
neighbours."</p>

<p>He placed the portmanteau on the floor, and
seemed about to leave the apartment, when, turning
about, he began a sort of apology for the rudeness
of his former behaviour.</p>

<p>"I trust there is no misunderstanding between
us, my worthy guest. You might as well expect
to see one of our bears come aloft and do tricks
like a jackanapes, as one of us stubborn old Germans
play the feats of a French or an Italian host.
Yet I pray you to note, that if our behaviour is
rude our charges are honest, and our articles what
they profess to be. We do not expect to make
Moselle pass for Rhenish, by dint of a bow and a
grin, nor will we sauce your mess with poison,
like the wily Italian, and call you all the time
Illustrissimo and Magnifico."</p>

<p>He seemed in these words to have exhausted his
rhetoric, for, when they were spoken, he turned
abruptly and left the apartment.</p>

<p>Philipson was thus deprived of another opportunity
to inquire who or what this ecclesiastic could
be, that had exercised such influence on all who
approached him. He felt, indeed, no desire to
prolong a conference with John Mengs, though he
had laid aside in such a considerable degree his
rude and repulsive manners; yet he longed to
know who this man could be, who had power with
a word to turn aside the daggers of Alsatian banditti,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
habituated as they were, like most borderers,
to robbery and pillage, and to change into civility
the proverbial rudeness of a German innkeeper.
Such were the reflections of Philipson, as he doffed
his clothes to take his much-needed repose, after a
day of fatigue, danger, and difficulty, on the pallet
afforded by the hospitality of the Golden Fleece,
in the Rhein-Thal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Macbeth.</i> How now, ye secret, black, and midnight hags,
What is't ye do?</p>

<p><i>Witches.</i> A deed without a name.</p>

<p class="i20"><i>Macbeth.</i></p>
</div>

<p>We have said in the conclusion of the last chapter,
that, after a day of unwonted fatigue and
extraordinary excitation, the merchant, Philipson,
naturally expected to forget so many agitating
passages in that deep and profound repose which
is at once the consequence and the cure of extreme
exhaustion. But he was no sooner laid on his
lowly pallet than he felt that the bodily machine,
over-laboured by so much exercise, was little disposed
to the charms of sleep. The mind had been
too much excited, the body was far too feverish,
to suffer him to partake of needful rest. His anxiety
about the safety of his son, his conjectures
concerning the issue of his mission to the Duke of
Burgundy, and a thousand other thoughts which
recalled past events, or speculated on those which
were to come, rushed upon his mind like the
waves of a perturbed sea, and prevented all tendency
to repose. He had been in bed about an
hour, and sleep had not yet approached his couch,
when he felt that the pallet on which he lay was
sinking below him, and that he was in the act of
descending along with it he knew not whither.
The sound of ropes and pulleys was also indistinctly
heard, though every caution had been taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
to make them run smooth; and the traveller, by
feeling around him, became sensible that he and
the bed on which he lay had been spread upon a
large trap-door, which was capable of being let
down into the vaults, or apartments beneath.</p>

<p>Philipson felt fear in circumstances so well
qualified to produce it; for how could he hope a
safe termination to an adventure which had begun
so strangely? But his apprehensions were those
of a brave, ready-witted man, who, even in the
extremity of danger, which appeared to surround
him, preserved his presence of mind. His descent
seemed to be cautiously managed, and he held
himself in readiness to start to his feet and defend
himself, as soon as he should be once more upon
firm ground. Although somewhat advanced in
years, he was a man of great personal vigour and
activity, and unless taken at advantage, which no
doubt was at present much to be apprehended, he
was likely to make a formidable defence. His
plan of resistance, however, had been anticipated.
He no sooner reached the bottom of the vault,
down to which he was lowered, than two men,
who had been waiting there till the operation was
completed, laid hands on him from either side,
and forcibly preventing him from starting up as
he intended, cast a rope over his arms, and made
him a prisoner as effectually as when he was
in the dungeons of La Ferette. He was obliged,
therefore, to remain passive and unresisting, and
await the termination of this formidable adventure.
Secured as he was, he could only turn his
head from one side to the other; and it was with
joy that he at length saw lights twinkle, but they
appeared at a great distance from him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>From the irregular manner in which these scattered
lights advanced, sometimes keeping a straight
line, sometimes mixing and crossing each other,
it might be inferred that the subterranean vault
in which they appeared was of very considerable
extent. Their number also increased; and as they
collected more together, Philipson could perceive
that the lights proceeded from many torches, borne
by men muffled in black cloaks, like mourners at
a funeral, or the Black Friars of St. Francis's
Order, wearing their cowls drawn over their heads,
so as to conceal their features. They appeared
anxiously engaged in measuring off a portion of
the apartment; and, while occupied in that employment,
they sang, in the ancient German language,
rhymes more rude than Philipson could well
understand, but which may be imitated thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Measurers of good and evil,</p>
<p>Bring the square, the line, the level,&mdash;</p>
<p>Rear the altar, dig the trench,</p>
<p>Blood both stone and ditch shall drench.</p>
<p>Cubits six, from end to end,</p>
<p>Must the fatal bench extend,&mdash;</p>
<p>Cubits six, from side to side,</p>
<p>Judge and culprit must divide.</p>
<p>On the east the Court assembles,</p>
<p>On the west the Accused trembles&mdash;</p>
<p>Answer, brethren, all and one,</p>
<p>Is the ritual rightly done?</p>
</div></div>

<p>A deep chorus seemed to reply to the question.
Many voices joined in it, as well of persons
already in the subterranean vault as of others who
as yet remained without in various galleries and
passages which communicated with it, and whom
Philipson now presumed to be very numerous.
The answer chanted ran as follows:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>On life and soul, on blood and bone,</p>
<p>One for all, and all for one,</p>
<p>We warrant this is rightly done.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The original strain was then renewed in the
same manner as before&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>How wears the night?&mdash;Doth morning shine</p>
<p>In early radiance on the Rhine?</p>
<p>What music floats upon his tide?</p>
<p>Do birds the tardy morning chide?</p>
<p>Brethren, look out from hill and height,</p>
<p>And answer true, how wears the night?</p>
</div></div>

<p>The answer was returned, though less loud than
at first, and it seemed that those by whom the
reply was given were at a much greater distance
than before; yet the words were distinctly heard.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>The night is old; on Rhine's broad breast</p>
<p>Glance drowsy stars which long to rest.</p>
<p class="i2">    No beams are twinkling in the east.</p>
<p>There is a voice upon the flood,</p>
<p>The stern still call of blood for blood;</p>
<p class="i2">    'Tis time we listen the behest.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The chorus replied, with many additional
voices&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Up, then, up! When day's at rest,</p>
<p>'Tis time that such as we are watchers;</p>
<p>Rise to judgment, brethren, rise!</p>
<p>Vengeance knows not sleepy eyes,</p>
<p>He and night are matchers.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The nature of the verses soon led Philipson to
comprehend that he was in presence of the Initiated,
or the Wise Men; names which were applied
to the celebrated Judges of the Secret Tribunal,
which continued at that period to subsist in
Suabia, Franconia, and other districts of the east
of Germany, which was called, perhaps from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
frightful and frequent occurrence of executions by
command of those invisible judges, the Red Land.
Philipson had often heard that the seat of a Free
Count, or chief of the Secret Tribunal, was secretly
instituted even on the left bank of the Rhine, and
that it maintained itself in Alsace, with the usual
tenacity of those secret societies, though Duke
Charles of Burgundy had expressed a desire to discover
and discourage its influence so far as was
possible, without exposing himself to danger from
the thousands of poniards which that mysterious
tribunal could put in activity against his own life;&mdash;an
awful means of defence, which for a long
time rendered it extremely hazardous for the sovereigns
of Germany, and even the Emperors themselves,
to put down by authority those singular
associations.</p>

<p>So soon as this explanation flashed on the mind
of Philipson, it gave some clue to the character
and condition of the Black Priest of St. Paul's.
Supposing him to be a president, or chief official
of the secret association, there was little wonder
that he should confide so much in the inviolability
of his terrible office as to propose vindicating the
execution of De Hagenbach; that his presence
should surprise Bartholomew, whom he had power
to have judged and executed upon the spot; and
that his mere appearance at supper on the preceding
evening should have appalled the guests; for
though everything about the institution, its proceedings
and its officers, was preserved in as much
obscurity as is now practised in free-masonry, yet
the secret was not so absolutely well kept as to
prevent certain individuals from being guessed or
hinted at as men initiated and intrusted with high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
authority by the Vehme-gericht, or tribunal of
the bounds. When such suspicion attached to
an individual, his secret power, and supposed acquaintance
with all guilt, however secret, which
was committed within the society in which he
was conversant, made him at once the dread and
hatred of every one who looked on him; and he
enjoyed a high degree of personal respect, on the
same terms on which it would have been yielded
to a powerful enchanter, or a dreaded genie. In
conversing with such a person, it was especially
necessary to abstain from all questions alluding,
however remotely, to the office which he bore in
the Secret Tribunal; and, indeed, to testify the
least curiosity upon a subject so solemn and mysterious
was sure to occasion some misfortune to
the inquisitive person.</p>

<p>All these things rushed at once upon the mind
of the Englishman, who felt that he had fallen
into the hands of an unsparing tribunal, whose
proceedings were so much dreaded by those who
resided within the circle of their power, that the
friendless stranger must stand a poor chance of
receiving justice at their hands, whatever might
be his consciousness of innocence. While Philipson
made this melancholy reflection, he resolved,
at the same time, not to forsake his own cause, but
defend himself as he best might; conscious as he
was that these terrible and irresponsible judges
were nevertheless governed by certain rules of
right and wrong, which formed a check on the
rigours of their extraordinary code.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i047" id="i047"></a>
<img src="images/i-047.jpg" width="367" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE SECRET TRIBUNAL.<br />
<span class="s08">Drawn and Etched by R. de los Rios.</span></p>
</div>

<p>He lay, therefore, devising the best means of
obviating the present danger, while the persons
whom he beheld glimmered before him, less like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
distinct and individual forms than like the phantoms
of a fever, or the phantasmagoria with which
a disease of the optic nerves has been known to
people a sick man's chamber. At length they
assembled in the centre of the apartment where
they had first appeared, and seemed to arrange
themselves into form and order. A great number
of black torches were successively lighted, and the
scene became distinctly visible. In the centre of
the hall, Philipson could now perceive one of the
altars which are sometimes to be found in ancient
subterranean chapels. But we must pause, in
order briefly to describe, not the appearance only,
but the nature and constitution, of this terrible
court.</p>

<p>Behind the altar, which seemed to be the central
point, on which all eyes were bent, there were
placed in parallel lines two benches covered with
black cloth. Each was occupied by a number of
persons, who seemed assembled as judges; but
those who held the foremost bench were fewer,
and appeared of a rank superior to those who
crowded the seat most remote from the altar. The
first seemed to be all men of some consequence,
priests high in their order, knights, or noblemen;
and notwithstanding an appearance of equality
which seemed to pervade this singular institution,
much more weight was laid upon their opinion,
or testimonies. They were called Free Knights,
Counts, or whatever title they might bear, while
the inferior class of the judges were only termed
Free and worthy Burghers. For it must be observed,
that the Vehmique Institution,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
 which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
was the name that it commonly bore, although its
power consisted in a wide system of espionage,
and the tyrannical application of force which acted
upon it, was yet (so rude were the ideas of enforcing
public law) accounted to confer a privilege on
the country in which it was received, and only
freemen were allowed to experience its influence.
Serfs and peasants could not have a place among
the Free Judges, their assessors, or assistants; for
there was in this assembly even some idea of trying
the culprit by his peers.</p>

<p>Besides the dignitaries who occupied the benches,
there were others who stood around, and seemed
to guard the various entrances to the hall of judgment,
or, standing behind the seats on which their
superiors were ranged, looked prepared to execute
their commands. These were members of the
order, though not of the highest ranks. Schöppen
is the name generally assigned to them, signifying
officials, or sergeants of the Vehmique court,
whose doom they stood sworn to enforce, through
good report and bad report, against their own
nearest and most beloved, as well as in cases of
ordinary malefactors.</p>

<p>The Schöppen, or Scabini, as they were termed
in Latin, had another horrible duty to perform&mdash;that,
namely, of denouncing to the tribunal whatever
came under their observation, that might be
construed as an offence falling under its cognisance;
or, in their language, a crime against the
Vehme. This duty extended to the judges as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
well as to the assistants, and was to be discharged
without respect of persons; so that, to know, and
wilfully conceal, the guilt of a mother or brother,
inferred, on the part of the unfaithful official, the
same penalty as if he himself had committed the
crime which his silence screened from punishment.
Such an institution could only prevail at
a time when ordinary means of justice were excluded
by the hand of power, and when, in order
to bring the guilty to punishment, it required all
the influence and authority of such a confederacy.
In no other country than one exposed to every
species of feudal tyranny, and deprived of every
ordinary mode of obtaining justice or redress, could
such a system have taken root and flourished.</p>

<p>We must now return to the brave Englishman,
who, though feeling all the danger he encountered
from so tremendous a tribunal, maintained nevertheless
a dignified and unaltered composure.</p>

<p>The meeting being assembled, a coil of ropes,
and a naked sword, the well-known signals and
emblems of Vehmique authority, were deposited
on the altar; where the sword, from its being
usually straight, with a cross handle, was considered
as representing the blessed emblem of Christian
Redemption, and the cord as indicating the right
of criminal jurisdiction, and capital punishment.
Then the President of the meeting, who occupied
the centre seat on the foremost bench, arose, and
laying his hand on the symbols, pronounced aloud
the formula expressive of the duty of the tribunal,
which all the inferior judges and assistants repeated
after him, in deep and hollow murmurs.</p>

<p>"I swear by the Holy Trinity, to aid and co-operate,
without relaxation, in the things belonging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
to the Holy Vehme, to defend its doctrines and
institutions against father and mother, brother
and sister, wife and children; against fire, water,
earth, and air; against all that the sun enlightens;
against all that the dew moistens; against all
created things of heaven and earth, or the waters
under the earth; and I swear to give information
to this holy judicature, of all that I know to be
true, or hear repeated by credible testimony,
which, by the rules of the Holy Vehme, is deserving
of animadversion or punishment; and that
I will not cloak, cover, or conceal, such my knowledge,
neither for love, friendship, or family affection,
nor for gold, silver, or precious stones;
neither will I associate with such as are under the
sentence of this Sacred Tribunal, by hinting to a
culprit his danger, or advising him to escape, or
aiding and supplying him with counsel, or means
to that effect; neither will I relieve such culprit
with fire, clothes, food, or shelter, though my
father should require from me a cup of water in
the heat of summer noon, or my brother should
request to sit by my fire in the bitterest cold night
of winter: And further, I vow and promise to
honour this holy association, and do its behests
speedily, faithfully, and firmly, in preference to
those of any other tribunal whatsoever&mdash;so help
me God, and His holy Evangelists."</p>

<p>When this oath of office had been taken, the
President addressing the assembly, as men who
judge in secret and punish in secret, like the
Deity, desired them to say, why this "child of the
cord"<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
 lay before them, bound and helpless. An
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
individual rose from the more remote bench, and
in a voice which, though altered and agitated,
Philipson conceived that he recognised, declared
himself the accuser, as bound by his oath, of the
child of the cord, or prisoner, who lay before
them.</p>

<p>"Bring forward the prisoner," said the President,
"duly secured, as is the order of our secret
law; but not with such severity as may interrupt
his attention to the proceedings of the tribunal,
or limit his power of hearing and replying."</p>

<p>Six of the assistants immediately dragged forward
the pallet and platform of boards on which
Philipson lay, and advanced it towards the foot of
the altar. This done, each unsheathed his dagger,
while two of them unloosed the cords by which the
merchant's hands were secured, and admonished
him in a whisper, that the slightest attempt to
resist or escape would be the signal to stab him
dead.</p>

<p>"Arise!" said the President; "listen to the
charge to be preferred against you, and believe you
shall in us find judges equally just and inflexible."</p>

<p>Philipson, carefully avoiding any gesture which
might indicate a desire to escape, raised his body
on the lower part of the couch, and remained
seated, clothed as he was in his under-vest and
<i>caleçons</i>, or drawers, so as exactly to face the
muffled President of the terrible court. Even in
these agitating circumstances, the mind of the
undaunted Englishman remained unshaken, and
his eyelid did not quiver, nor his heart beat
quicker, though he seemed, according to the expression
of Scripture, to be a pilgrim in the Valley
of the Shadow of Death, beset by numerous snares,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
and encompassed by total darkness, where light was
most necessary for safety.</p>

<p>The President demanded his name, country, and
occupation.</p>

<p>"John Philipson," was the reply; "by birth an
Englishman, by profession a merchant."</p>

<p>"Have you ever borne any other name and profession?"
demanded the Judge.</p>

<p>"I have been a soldier, and, like most others,
had then a name by which I was known in war."</p>

<p>"What was that name?"</p>

<p>"I laid it aside when I resigned my sword, and
I do not desire again to be known by it. Moreover,
I never bore it where your institutions have
weight and authority," answered the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Know you before whom you stand?" continued
the Judge.</p>

<p>"I may at least guess," replied the merchant.</p>

<p>"Tell your guess, then," continued the interrogator.
"Say who we are, and wherefore are you
before us?"</p>

<p>"I believe that I am before the Unknown, or
Secret Tribunal, which is called Vehme-gericht."</p>

<p>"Then are you aware," answered the Judge,
"that you would be safer if you were suspended by
the hair over the Abyss of Schaffhausen, or if you
lay below an axe, which a thread of silk alone
kept back from the fall. What have you done to
deserve such a fate?"</p>

<p>"Let those reply by whom I am subjected to
it," answered Philipson, with the same composure
as before.</p>

<p>"Speak, accuser!" said the President, "to the
four quarters of heaven!&mdash;To the ears of the free
judges of this tribunal, and the faithful executors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
of their doom!&mdash;And to the face of the child of
the cord, who denies or conceals his guilt, make
good the substance of thine accusation!"</p>

<p>"Most dreaded," answered the accuser, addressing
the President, "this man hath entered the
Sacred Territory, which is called the Red Land,&mdash;a
stranger under a disguised name and profession.
When he was yet on the eastern side of the Alps,
at Turin, in Lombardy, and elsewhere, he at various
times spoke of the Holy Tribunal in terms of
hatred and contempt, and declared that were he
Duke of Burgundy he would not permit it to extend
itself from Westphalia, or Suabia, into his
dominions. Also I charge him, that, nourishing
this malevolent intention against the Holy Tribunal,
he who now appears before the bench as child
of the cord has intimated his intention to wait
upon the court of the Duke of Burgundy, and use
his influence with him, which he boasts will prove
effectual to stir him up to prohibit the meetings of
the Holy Vehme in his dominions, and to inflict on
their officers, and the executors of their mandates,
the punishment due to robbers and assassins."</p>

<p>"This is a heavy charge, brother!" said the
President of the assembly, when the accuser
ceased speaking. "How do you purpose to make
it good?"</p>

<p>"According to the tenor of those secret statutes
the perusal of which is prohibited to all but the
initiated," answered the accuser.</p>

<p>"It is well," said the President; "but I ask
thee once more, What are those means of proof?
You speak to holy and to initiated ears."</p>

<p>"I will prove my charge," said the accuser, "by
the confession of the party himself, and by my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
own oath upon the holy emblems of the Secret
Judgment&mdash;that is, the steel and the cord."</p>

<p>"It is a legitimate offer of proof," said a member
of the aristocratic bench of the assembly;
"and it much concerns the safety of the system to
which we are bound by such deep oaths&mdash;a system
handed down to us from the most Christian and
holy Roman Emperor, Charlemagne, for the conversion
of the heathen Saracens, and punishing
such of them as revolted again to their Pagan
practices, that such criminals should be looked to.
This Duke Charles of Burgundy hath already
crowded his army with foreigners, whom he can
easily employ against this Sacred Court, more
especially with English, a fierce, insular people,
wedded to their own usages, and hating those of
every other nation. It is not unknown to us, that
the Duke hath already encouraged opposition to
the officials of the Tribunal in more than one part
of his German dominions; and that in consequence,
instead of submitting to their doom with
reverent resignation, children of the cord have
been found bold enough to resist the executioners
of the Vehme, striking, wounding, and even slaying
those who have received commission to put
them to death. This contumacy must be put an
end to; and if the accused shall be proved to be
one of those by whom such doctrines are harboured
and inculcated, I say let the steel and cord do
their work on him."</p>

<p>A general murmur seemed to approve what the
speaker had said; for all were conscious that the
power of the Tribunal depended much more on
the opinion of its being deeply and firmly rooted in
the general system, than upon any regard or esteem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
for an institution of which all felt the severity.
It followed, that those of the members who enjoyed
consequence by means of their station in the ranks
of the Vehme saw the necessity of supporting its
terrors by occasional examples of severe punishment;
and none could be more readily sacrificed
than an unknown and wandering foreigner. All
this rushed upon Philipson's mind, but did not
prevent his making a steady reply to the accusation.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, "good citizens, burgesses,
or by whatever other name you please to be addressed,
know, that in my former days I have
stood in as great peril as now, and have never
turned my heel to save my life. Cords and daggers
are not calculated to strike terror into those
who have seen swords and lances. My answer to
the accusation is, that I am an Englishman, one
of a nation accustomed to yield and to receive
open-handed and equal justice dealt forth in the
broad light of day. I am, however, a traveller,
who knows that he has no right to oppose the
rules and laws of other nations because they do
not resemble those of his own. But this caution
can only be called for in lands where the system
about which we converse is in full force and operation.
If we speak of the institutions of Germany,
being at the time in France or Spain, we may,
without offence to the country in which they are
current, dispute concerning them, as students debate
upon a logical thesis in a university. The
accuser objects to me, that at Turin, or elsewhere
in the north of Italy, I spoke with censure of the
institution under which I am now judged. I will
not deny that I remember something of the kind;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
but it was in consequence of the question being
in a manner forced upon me by two guests with
whom I chanced to find myself at table. I was
much and earnestly solicited for an opinion ere
I gave one."</p>

<p>"And was that opinion," said the presiding
Judge, "favourable or otherwise to the Holy and
Secret Vehme-gericht? Let truth rule your tongue&mdash;remember,
life is short, judgment is eternal!"</p>

<p>"I would not save my life at the expense of a
falsehood. My opinion was unfavourable; and I
expressed myself thus:&mdash;No laws or judicial proceedings
can be just or commendable which exist
and operate by means of a secret combination. I
said, that justice could only live and exist in the
open air, and that when she ceased to be public
she degenerated into revenge and hatred. I said,
that a system of which your own jurists have said,
<i>non frater a fratre, non hospes a hospite, tutus</i>,
was too much adverse to the laws of nature to be
connected with or regulated by those of religion."</p>

<p>These words were scarcely uttered, when there
burst a murmur from the Judges highly unfavourable
to the prisoner,&mdash;"He blasphemes the Holy
Vehme&mdash;Let his mouth be closed for ever!"</p>

<p>"Hear me," said the Englishman, "as you will
one day wish to be yourselves heard! I say such
were my sentiments, and so I expressed them&mdash;I
say also, I had a right to express these opinions,
whether sound or erroneous, in a neutral country,
where this Tribunal neither did, nor could, claim
any jurisdiction. My sentiments are still the
same. I would avow them if that sword were at
my bosom, or that cord around my throat. But I
deny that I have ever spoken against the institutions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
of your Vehme, in a country where it had its
course as a national mode of justice. Far more
strongly, if possible, do I denounce the absurdity
of the falsehood, which represents me, a wandering
foreigner, as commissioned to traffic with the
Duke of Burgundy about such high matters, or to
form a conspiracy for the destruction of a system
to which so many seem warmly attached. I never
said such a thing, and I never thought it."</p>

<p>"Accuser," said the presiding Judge, "thou hast
heard the accused&mdash;What is thy reply?"</p>

<p>"The first part of the charge," said the accuser,
"he hath confessed in this high presence&mdash;namely,
that his foul tongue hath basely slandered our holy
mysteries; for which he deserves that it should be
torn out of his throat. I myself, on my oath of
office, will aver, as use and law is, that the rest of
the accusation&mdash;namely, that which taxes him as
having entered into machinations for the destruction
of the Vehmique institutions&mdash;is as true as
those which he has found himself unable to deny."</p>

<p>"In justice," said the Englishman, "the accusation,
if not made good by satisfactory proof, ought
to be left to the oath of the party accused, instead
of permitting the accuser to establish by his own
deposition the defects in his own charge."</p>

<p>"Stranger," replied the presiding Judge, "we
permit to thy ignorance a longer and more full
defence than consists with our usual forms. Know,
that the right of sitting among these venerable
judges confers on the person of him who enjoys it
a sacredness of character which ordinary men cannot
attain to. The oath of one of the initiated
must counterbalance the most solemn asseveration
of every one that is not acquainted with our holy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
secrets. In the Vehmique court all must be
Vehmique. The averment of the Emperor, he
being uninitiated, would not have so much weight
in our counsels as that of one of the meanest of
these officials. The affirmation of the accuser can
only be rebutted by the oath of a member of the
same Tribunal, being of superior rank."</p>

<p>"Then, God be gracious to me, for I have no
trust save in Heaven!" said the Englishman, in
solemn accents. "Yet I will not fall without an
effort. I call upon thee thyself, dark spirit, who
presidest in this most deadly assembly&mdash;I call
upon thyself, to declare on thy faith and honour,
whether thou holdest me guilty of what is thus
boldly averred by this false calumniator&mdash;I call
upon thee by thy sacred character&mdash;by the name
of"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold!" replied the presiding Judge. "The
name by which we are known in open air must
not be pronounced in this subterranean judgment-seat."</p>

<p>He then proceeded to address the prisoner and
the assembly.&mdash;"I, being called on in evidence,
declare that the charge against thee is so far true
as it is acknowledged by thyself&mdash;namely, that
thou hast in other lands than the Red Soil<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
 spoken
lightly of this holy institution of justice. But I
believe in my soul, and will bear witness on my
honour, that the rest of the accusation is incredible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
and false. And this I swear, holding my hand on
the dagger and the cord.&mdash;What is your judgment,
my brethren, upon the case which you have
investigated?"</p>

<p>A member of the first-seated and highest class
amongst the judges, muffled like the rest, but the
tone of whose voice and the stoop of whose person
announced him to be more advanced in years than
the other two who had before spoken, arose with
difficulty, and said with a trembling voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The child of the cord who is before us has been
convicted of folly and rashness in slandering our
holy institution. But he spoke his folly to ears
which had never heard our sacred laws&mdash;He has,
therefore, been acquitted, by irrefragable testimony,
of combining for the impotent purpose of
undermining our power, or stirring up princes
against our holy association, for which death were
too light a punishment&mdash;He hath been foolish,
then, but not criminal; and as the holy laws of
the Vehme bear no penalty save that of death, I
propose for judgment that the child of the cord be
restored without injury to society, and to the
upper world, having been first duly admonished of
his errors."</p>

<p>"Child of the cord," said the presiding Judge,
"thou hast heard thy sentence of acquittal. But,
as thou desirest to sleep in an unbloody grave, let
me warn thee, that the secrets of this night shall
remain with thee, as a secret not to be communicated
to father nor mother, to spouse, son, or
daughter; neither to be spoken aloud nor whispered;
to be told in words or written in characters;
to be carved or to be painted, or to be otherwise
communicated, either directly or by parable and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
emblem. Obey this behest, and thy life is in
surety. Let thy heart then rejoice within thee,
but let it rejoice with trembling. Never more let
thy vanity persuade thee that thou art secure from
the servants and Judges of the Holy Vehme.
Though a thousand leagues lie between thee and
the Red Land, and thou speakest in that where
our power is not known; though thou shouldst be
sheltered by thy native island, and defended by
thy kindred ocean, yet, even there, I warn thee to
cross thyself when thou dost so much as think
of the Holy and Invisible Tribunal, and to retain
thy thoughts within thine own bosom; for the
Avenger may be beside thee, and thou mayst die
in thy folly. Go hence, be wise, and let the fear
of the Holy Vehme never pass from before thine
eyes."</p>

<p>At the concluding words, all the lights were at
once extinguished with a hissing noise. Philipson
felt once more the grasp of the hands of the
officials, to which he resigned himself as the safest
course. He was gently prostrated on his pallet-bed,
and transported back to the place from which
he had been advanced to the foot of the altar.
The cordage was again applied to the platform,
and Philipson was sensible that his couch rose
with him for a few moments, until a slight shock
apprised him that he was again brought to a level
with the floor of the chamber in which he had
been lodged on the preceding night, or rather
morning. He pondered over the events that had
passed, in which he was sensible that he owed
Heaven thanks for a great deliverance. Fatigue
at length prevailed over anxiety, and he fell into
a deep and profound sleep, from which he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
only awakened by returning light. He resolved
on an instant departure from so dangerous a spot,
and, without seeing any one of the household but
the old ostler, pursued his journey to Strasburg,
and reached that city without further accident.

<p class="i7"><i>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto III.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>When Arthur Philipson left his father, to go on
board the bark which was to waft him across the
Rhine, he took but few precautions for his own
subsistence, during a separation of which he calculated
the duration to be very brief. Some necessary
change of raiment, and a very few pieces of
gold, were all which he thought it needful to
withdraw from the general stock; the rest of the
baggage and money he left with the sumpter-horse,
which he concluded his father might need,
in order to sustain his character as an English
trader. Having embarked with his horse and his
slender appointments on board a fishing-skiff, she
instantly raised her temporary mast, spread a sail
across the yard, and, supported by the force of the
wind against the downward power of the current,
moved across the river obliquely in the direction
of Kirch-hoff, which, as we have said, lies somewhat
lower on the river than Hans-Kapelle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Their passage was so favourable that they reached
the opposite side in a few minutes, but not until
Arthur, whose eye and thoughts were on the left
bank, had seen his father depart from the Chapel
of the Ferry, accompanied by two horsemen, whom
he readily concluded to be the guide Bartholomew,
and some chance traveller who had joined him;
but the second of whom was in truth the Black
Priest of St. Paul's, as has been already mentioned.</p>

<p>This augmentation of his father's company was,
he could not but think, likely to be attended with
an increase of his safety, since it was not probable
he would suffer a companion to be forced upon
him, and one of his own choosing might be a protection,
in case his guide should prove treacherous.
At any rate, he had to rejoice that he had seen his
father depart in safety from the spot where they
had reason to apprehend some danger awaited
him. He resolved, therefore, to make no stay at
Kirch-hoff, but to pursue his way, as fast as possible,
towards Strasburg, and rest, when darkness
compelled him to stop, in one of the <i>dorfs</i>, or villages,
which were situated on the German side
of the Rhine. At Strasburg, he trusted, with the
sanguine spirit of youth, he might again be able
to rejoin his father; and if he could not altogether
subdue his anxiety on their separation, he fondly
nourished the hope that he might meet him in
safety. After some short refreshment and repose
afforded to his horse, he lost no time in proceeding
on his journey down the eastern bank of the broad
river.</p>

<p>He was now upon the most interesting side of
the Rhine, walled in and repelled as the river is
on that shore by the most romantic cliffs, now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
mantled with vegetation of the richest hue, tinged
with all the variegated colours of autumn; now
surmounted by fortresses, over whose gates were
displayed the pennons of their proud owners; or
studded with hamlets, where the richness of the
soil supplied to the poor labourer the food of which
the oppressive hand of his superior threatened
altogether to deprive him. Every stream which
here contributes its waters to the Rhine winds
through its own tributary dell, and each valley
possesses a varying and separate character, some
rich with pastures, cornfields, and vineyards, some
frowning with crags and precipices, and other
romantic beauties.</p>

<p>The principles of taste were not then explained
or analysed as they have been since, in countries
where leisure has been found for this investigation.
But the feelings arising from so rich a landscape
as is displayed by the valley of the Rhine
must have been the same in every bosom, from the
period when our Englishman took his solitary
journey through it, in doubt and danger, till that
in which it heard the indignant Childe Harold bid
a proud farewell to his native country, in the vain
search of a land in which his heart might throb
less fiercely.</p>

<p>Arthur enjoyed this scene, although the fading
daylight began to remind him that, alone as he
was, and travelling with a very valuable charge, it
would be matter of prudence to look out for some
place of rest during the night. Just as he had
formed the resolution of inquiring at the next
habitation he should pass, which way he should
follow for this purpose, the road he pursued descended
into a beautiful amphitheatre filled with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
large trees, which protected from the heats of
summer the delicate and tender herbage of the
pasture. A large brook flowed through it, and
joined the Rhine. At a short mile up the brook
its waters made a crescent round a steep craggy
eminence, crowned with flanking walls, and Gothic
towers and turrets, enclosing a feudal castle of
the first order. A part of the savannah that has
been mentioned had been irregularly cultivated for
wheat, which had grown a plentiful crop. It was
gathered in, but the patches of deep yellow stubble
contrasted with the green of the undisturbed
pasture land, and with the seared and dark-red
foliage of the broad oaks which stretched their
arms athwart the level space. There a lad, in a
rustic dress, was employed in the task of netting
a brood of partridges with the assistance of a
trained spaniel; while a young woman, who had
the air rather of a domestic in some family of
rank than that of an ordinary villager, sat on the
stump of a decayed tree, to watch the progress of
the amusement. The spaniel, whose duty it was
to drive the partridges under the net, was perceptibly
disturbed at the approach of the traveller;
his attention was divided, and he was obviously
in danger of marring the sport, by barking and
putting up the covey, when the maiden quitted
her seat, and, advancing towards Philipson, requested
him, for courtesy, to pass at a greater distance,
and not interfere with their amusement.</p>

<p>The traveller willingly complied with her
request.</p>

<p>"I will ride, fair damsel," he said, "at whatever
distance you please. And allow me, in guerdon,
to ask, whether there is convent, castle, or good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
man's house, where a stranger, who is belated and
weary, might receive a night's hospitality?"</p>

<p>The girl, whose face he had not yet distinctly
seen, seemed to suppress some desire to laugh, as
she replied, "Hath not yon castle, think you,"
pointing to the distant towers, "some corner which
might accommodate a stranger in such extremity?"</p>

<p>"Space enough, certainly," said Arthur; "but
perhaps little inclination to grant it."</p>

<p>"I myself," said the girl, "being one, and a
formidable part of the garrison, will be answerable
for your reception. But as you parley with me
in such hostile fashion, it is according to martial
order that I should put down my visor."</p>

<p>So saying, she concealed her face under one of
those riding-masks which at that period women
often wore when they went abroad, whether for
protecting their complexion or screening themselves
from intrusive observation. But ere she
could accomplish this operation Arthur had detected
the merry countenance of Annette Veilchen, a girl
who, though her attendance on Anne of Geierstein
was in a menial capacity, was held in high estimation
at Geierstein. She was a bold wench, unaccustomed
to the distinctions of rank, which were
little regarded in the simplicity of the Helvetian
hills, and she was ready to laugh, jest, and flirt
with the young men of the Landamman's family.
This attracted no attention, the mountain manners
making little distinction between the degrees of
attendant and mistress, further than that the mistress
was a young woman who required help, and
the maiden one who was in a situation to offer and
afford it. This kind of familiarity would perhaps
have been dangerous in other lands, but the simplicity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
of Swiss manners, and the turn of Annette's
disposition, which was resolute and sensible,
though rather bold and free, when compared to
the manners of more civilised countries, kept
all intercourse betwixt her and the young men
of the family in the strict path of honour and
innocence.</p>

<p>Arthur himself had paid considerable attention
to Annette, being naturally, from his feelings
towards Anne of Geierstein, heartily desirous to
possess the good graces of her attendant; a point
which was easily gained by the attentions of a
handsome young man, and the generosity with
which he heaped upon her small presents of articles
of dress or ornament, which the damsel,
however faithful, could find no heart to refuse.</p>

<p>The assurance that he was in Anne's neighbourhood,
and that he was likely to pass the night
under the same roof, both of which circumstances
were intimated by the girl's presence and language,
sent the blood in a hastier current through
Arthur's veins; for though, since he had crossed
the river, he had sometimes nourished hopes of
again seeing her who had made so strong an impression
on his imagination, yet his understanding
had as often told him how slight was the chance
of their meeting, and it was even now chilled by
the reflection that it could be followed only by the
pain of a sudden and final separation. He yielded
himself, however, to the prospect of promised
pleasure, without attempting to ascertain what
was to be its duration or its consequence. Desirous,
in the meantime, to hear as much of Anne's
circumstances as Annette chose to tell, he resolved
not to let that merry maiden perceive that she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
known by him, until she chose of her own accord
to lay aside her mystery.</p>

<p>While these thoughts passed rapidly through
his imagination, Annette bade the lad drop his
nets, and directed him that, having taken two of
the best-fed partridges from the covey, and carried
them into the kitchen, he was to set the rest at
liberty.</p>

<p>"I must provide supper," said she to the
traveller, "since I am bringing home unexpected
company."</p>

<p>Arthur earnestly expressed his hope that his
experiencing the hospitality of the castle would occasion
no trouble to the inmates, and received satisfactory
assurances upon the subject of his scruples.</p>

<p>"I would not willingly be the cause of inconvenience
to your mistress," pursued the traveller.</p>

<p>"Look you there," said Annette Veilchen, "I
have said nothing of master or mistress, and this
poor forlorn traveller has already concluded in his
own mind that he is to be harboured in a lady's
bower!"</p>

<p>"Why, did you not tell me," said Arthur, somewhat
confused at his blunder, "that you were the
person of second importance in the place? A
damsel, I judged, could only be an officer under a
female governor."</p>

<p>"I do not see the justice of the conclusion,"
replied the maiden. "I have known ladies bear
offices of trust in lords' families; nay, and over
the lords themselves."</p>

<p>"Am I to understand, fair damsel, that you
hold so predominant a situation in the castle
which we are now approaching, and of which I
pray you to tell me the name?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>"The name of the castle is Arnheim," said
Annette.</p>

<p>"Your garrison must be a large one," said
Arthur, looking at the extensive building, "if
you are able to man such a labyrinth of walls
and towers."</p>

<p>"In that point," said Annette, "I must needs
own we are very deficient. At present, we rather
hide in the castle than inhabit it; and yet it
is well enough defended by the reports which
frighten every other person who might disturb its
seclusion."</p>

<p>"And yet you yourselves dare to reside in it?"
said the Englishman, recollecting the tale which
had been told by Rudolph Donnerhugel, concerning
the character of the Barons of Arnheim, and
the final catastrophe of the family.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," replied his guide, "we are too intimate
with the cause of such fears to feel ourselves
strongly oppressed with them&mdash;perhaps we have
means of encountering the supposed terrors proper
to ourselves&mdash;perhaps, and it is not the least
likely conjecture, we have no choice of a better
place of refuge. Such seems to be your own fate
at present, sir, for the tops of the distant hills are
gradually losing the lights of the evening; and if
you rest not in Arnheim, well contented or not,
you are likely to find no safe lodging for many a
mile."</p>

<p>As she thus spoke she separated from Arthur,
taking, with the fowler who attended her, a very
steep but short footpath, which ascended straight
up to the site of the castle; at the same time
motioning to the young Englishman to follow a
horse-track, which, more circuitous, led to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
same point, and, though less direct, was considerably
more easy.</p>

<p>He soon stood before the south front of Arnheim
Castle, which was a much larger building than he
had conceived, either from Rudolph's description
or from the distant view. It had been erected
at many different periods, and a considerable part
of the edifice was less in the strict Gothic than
in what has been termed the Saracenic style,
in which the imagination of the architect is
more florid than that which is usually indulged in
the North&mdash;rich in minarets, cupolas, and similar
approximations to Oriental structures. This
singular building bore a general appearance of
desolation and desertion, but Rudolph had been
misinformed when he declared that it had become
ruinous. On the contrary, it had been maintained
with considerable care; and when it fell into the
hands of the Emperor, although no garrison was
maintained within its precincts, care was taken to
keep the building in repair; and though the prejudices
of the country people prevented any one from
passing the night within the fearful walls, yet it
was regularly visited from time to time by a person
having commission from the Imperial Chancery
to that effect. The occupation of the domain
around the castle was a valuable compensation for
this official person's labour, and he took care not
to endanger the loss of it by neglecting his duty.
Of late this officer had been withdrawn, and now
it appeared that the young Baroness of Arnheim
had found refuge in the deserted towers of her
ancestors.</p>

<p>The Swiss damsel did not leave the youthful
traveller time to study particularly the exterior of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
the castle, or to construe the meaning of emblems
and mottoes, seemingly of an Oriental character,
with which the outside was inscribed, and which
expressed in various modes, more or less directly,
the attachment of the builders of this extensive
pile to the learning of the Eastern sages. Ere he
had time to take more than a general survey of
the place, the voice of the Swiss maiden called
him to an angle of the wall in which there was a
projection, whence a long plank extended over a
dry moat, and was connected with a window in
which Annette was standing.</p>

<p>"You have forgotten your Swiss lessons already,"
said she, observing that Arthur went rather
timidly about crossing the temporary and precarious
drawbridge.</p>

<p>The reflection that Anne, her mistress, might
make the same observation, recalled the young
traveller to the necessary degree of composure.
He passed over the plank with the same <i>sang froid</i>
with which he had learned to brave the far more
terrific bridge beneath the ruinous castle of Geierstein.
He had no sooner entered the window than
Annette, taking off her mask, bade him welcome
to Germany, and to old friends with new names.</p>

<p>"Anne of Geierstein," she said, "is no more;
but you will presently see the Lady Baroness of
Arnheim, who is extremely like her; and I, who
was Annette Veilchen in Switzerland, the servant
to a damsel who was not esteemed much greater
than myself, am now the young Baroness's waiting-woman,
and make everybody of less quality
stand back."</p>

<p>"If, in such circumstances," said young Philipson,
"you have the influence due to your consequence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
let me beseech of you to tell the Baroness,
since we must now call her so, that my present
intrusion on her is occasioned by my ignorance."</p>

<p>"Away, away!" said the girl, laughing. "I
know better what to say in your behalf. You are
not the first poor man and pedlar that has got the
graces of a great lady; but I warrant you it was
not by making humble apologies, and talking of
unintentional intrusion. I will tell her of love,
which all the Rhine cannot quench, and which
has driven you hither, leaving you no other choice
than to come or to perish!"</p>

<p>"Nay, but Annette, Annette"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fie on you for a fool,&mdash;make a shorter name
of it,&mdash;cry Anne, Anne! and there will be more
prospect of your being answered."</p>

<p>So saying, the wild girl ran out of the room,
delighted, as a mountaineer of her description was
likely to be, with the thought of having done as
she would desire to be done by, in her benevolent
exertions to bring two lovers together, when on
the eve of inevitable separation.</p>

<p>In this self-approving disposition, Annette sped
up a narrow turnpike stair to a closet, or dressing-room,
where her young mistress was seated, and
exclaimed, with open mouth,&mdash;"Anne of Gei&mdash;&mdash;,
I mean my Lady Baroness, they are come&mdash;they
are come!"</p>

<p>"The Philipsons?" said Anne, almost breathless
as she asked the question.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no&mdash;" answered the girl; "that is, yes,&mdash;for
the best of them is come, and that is
Arthur."</p>

<p>"What meanest thou, girl? Is not Seignor
Philipson, the father, along with his son?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>"Not he, indeed," answered Veilchen, "nor did
I ever think of asking about him. He was no
friend of mine, nor of any one else, save the old
Landamman; and well met they were for a couple
of wiseacres, with eternal proverbs in their mouths,
and care upon their brows."</p>

<p>"Unkind, inconsiderate girl, what hast thou
done?" said Anne of Geierstein. "Did I not
warn and charge thee to bring them both hither?
and you have brought the young man alone to a
place where we are nearly in solitude! What will
he&mdash;what can he think of me?"</p>

<p>"Why, what should I have done?" said
Annette, remaining firm in her argument. "He
was alone, and should I have sent him down to
the <i>dorf</i> to be murdered by the Rhinegrave's Lanzknechts?
All is fish, I trow, that comes to their
net; and how is he to get through this country,
so beset with wandering soldiers, robber barons (I
beg your ladyship's pardon), and roguish Italians,
flocking to the Duke of Burgundy's standard?&mdash;Not
to mention the greatest terror of all, that is
never in one shape or other absent from one's eye
or thought."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, girl! add not utter madness to
the excess of folly; but let us think what is to be
done. For our sake, for his own, this unfortunate
young man must leave this castle instantly."</p>

<p>"You must take the message yourself, then,
Anne&mdash;I beg pardon, most noble Baroness;&mdash;it
may be very fit for a lady of high birth to send
such a message, which, indeed, I have heard the
Minne-singers tell in their romances; but I am
sure it is not a meet one for me, or any frank-hearted
Swiss girl, to carry. No more foolery;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
but remember, if you were born Baroness of Arnheim,
you have been bred and brought up in the
bosom of the Swiss hills, and should conduct
yourself like an honest and well-meaning damsel."</p>

<p>"And in what does your wisdom reprehend my
folly, good Mademoiselle Annette?" replied the
Baroness.</p>

<p>"Ay, marry! now our noble blood stirs in our
veins. But remember, gentle my lady, that it
was a bargain between us, when I left yonder
noble mountains, and the free air that blows over
them, to coop myself up in this land of prisons
and slaves, that I should speak my mind to you as
freely as I did when our heads lay on the same
pillow."</p>

<p>"Speak, then," said Anne, studiously averting
her face as she prepared to listen; "but beware
that you say nothing which it is unfit for me to
hear."</p>

<p>"I will speak nature and common-sense; and if
your noble ears are not made fit to hear and understand
these, the fault lies in them, and not in my
tongue. Look you, you have saved this youth
from two great dangers&mdash;one at the earth-shoot at
Geierstein, the other this very day, when his life
was beset. A handsome young man he is, well
spoken, and well qualified to gain deservedly a
lady's favour. Before you saw him, the Swiss
youth were at least not odious to you. You danced
with them,&mdash;you jested with them,&mdash;you were
the general object of their admiration,&mdash;and, as
you well know, you might have had your choice
through the Canton&mdash;Why, I think it possible a
little urgency might have brought you to think of
Rudolph Donnerhugel as your mate."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>"Never, wench, never!" exclaimed Anne.</p>

<p>"Be not so very positive, my lady. Had he
recommended himself to the uncle in the first
place, I think, in my poor sentiment, he might at
some lucky moment have carried the niece. But
since we have known this young Englishman, it
has been little less than contemning, despising,
and something like hating, all the men whom you
could endure well enough before."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Anne, "I will detest and
hate thee more than any of them, unless you bring
your matters to an end."</p>

<p>"Softly, noble lady, fair and easy go far. All
this argues you love the young man, and let those
say that you are wrong who think there is anything
wonderful in the matter. There is much
to justify you, and nothing that I know against
it."</p>

<p>"What, foolish girl! Remember my birth forbids
me to love a mean man&mdash;my condition to
love a poor man&mdash;my father's commands to love
one whose addresses are without his consent&mdash;above
all, my maidenly pride forbids me fixing my
affections on one who cares not for me&mdash;nay, perhaps,
is prejudiced against me by appearances."</p>

<p>"Here is a fine homily!" said Annette; "but
I can clear every point of it as easily as Father
Francis does his text in a holiday sermon. Your
birth is a silly dream, which you have only learned
to value within these two or three days, when,
having come to German soil, some of the old German
weed, usually called family pride, has begun
to germinate in your heart. Think of such folly
as you thought when you lived at Geierstein&mdash;that
is, during all the rational part of your life,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
and this great terrible prejudice will sink into
nothing. By condition, I conceive you mean
estate. But Philipson's father, who is the most
free-hearted of men, will surely give his son as
many zechins as will stock a mountain farm. You
have firewood for the cutting, and land for the
occupying, since you are surely entitled to part of
Geierstein, and gladly will your uncle put you in
possession of it. You can manage the dairy,
Arthur can shoot, hunt, fish, plough, harrow, and
reap."</p>

<p>Anne of Geierstein shook her head, as if she
greatly doubted her lover's skill in the last of the
accomplishments enumerated.</p>

<p>"Well, well, he can learn, then," said Annette
Veilchen; "and you will only live the harder the
first year or so. Besides, Sigismund Biederman
will aid him willingly, and he is a very horse at
labour; and I know another besides, who is a
friend"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of thine own, I warrant," quoth the young
Baroness.</p>

<p>"Marry, it is my poor friend Louis Sprenger;
and I'll never be so false-hearted as to deny my
bachelor."</p>

<p>"Well, well, but what is to be the end of all
this?" said the Baroness, impatiently.</p>

<p>"The end of it, in my opinion," said Annette,
"is very simple. Here are priests and prayer-books
within a mile&mdash;go down to the parlour,
speak your mind to your lover, or hear him speak
his mind to you; join hands, go quietly back to
Geierstein in the character of man and wife, and
get everything ready to receive your uncle on his
return. This is the way that a plain Swiss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
wench would cut off the romance of a German
Baroness"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And break the heart of her father," said the
young lady, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"It is more tough than you are aware of," replied
Annette. "He hath not lived without you
so long but that he will be able to spare you for
the rest of his life, a great deal more easily than
you, with all your new-fangled ideas of quality,
will be able to endure his schemes of wealth and
ambition, which will aim at making you the wife
of some illustrious Count, like De Hagenbach,
whom we saw not long since make such an edifying
end, to the great example of all Robber-Chivalry
upon the Rhine."</p>

<p>"Thy plan is naught, wench; a childish vision
of a girl who never knew more of life than she has
heard told over her milking-pail. Remember that
my uncle entertains the highest ideas of family
discipline, and that to act contrary to my father's
will would destroy us in his good opinion. Why
else am I here? Wherefore has he resigned his
guardianship? And why am I obliged to change
the habits that are dear to me, and assume the
manners of a people that are strange, and therefore
unpleasing to me?"</p>

<p>"Your uncle," said Annette firmly, "is Landamman
of the Canton of Unterwalden; respects
its freedom, and is the sworn protector of its laws,
of which, when you, a denizen of the Confederacy,
claim the protection, he cannot refuse it to you."</p>

<p>"Even then," said the young Baroness, "I
should forfeit his good opinion, his more than
paternal affection; but it is needless to dwell upon
this. Know, that although I could have loved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
the young man, whom I will not deny to be as
amiable as your partiality paints him&mdash;know,"&mdash;she
hesitated for a moment,&mdash;"that he has never
spoken a word to me on such a subject as you,
without knowing either his sentiments or mine,
would intrude on my consideration."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" answered Annette. "I
thought&mdash;I believed, though I have never pressed
on your confidence&mdash;that you must&mdash;attached as
you were to each other&mdash;have spoken together,
like true maid and true bachelor, before now. I
have done wrong, when I thought to do for the
best.&mdash;Is it possible!&mdash;such things have been
heard of even in our canton&mdash;is it possible he can
have harboured so unutterably base purposes, as
that Martin of Brisach, who made love to Adela
of the Sundgau, enticed her to folly&mdash;the thing,
though almost incredible, is true&mdash;fled&mdash;fled
from the country and boasted of his villany, till
her cousin Raymund silenced for ever his infamous
triumph, by beating his brains out with his club,
even in the very street of the villain's native
town? By the Holy Mother of Einsiedlen! could
I suspect this Englishman of meditating such
treason, I would saw the plank across the moat
till a fly's weight would break it, and it should be
at six fathom deep that he should abye the perfidy
which dared to meditate dishonour against an
adopted daughter of Switzerland!"</p>

<p>As Annette Veilchen spoke, all the fire of her
mountain courage flashed from her eyes, and she
listened reluctantly while Anne of Geierstein endeavoured
to obliterate the dangerous impression
which her former words had impressed on her
simple but faithful attendant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>"On my word"&mdash;she said,&mdash;"on my soul&mdash;you
do Arthur Philipson injustice&mdash;foul injustice, in
intimating such a suspicion;&mdash;his conduct towards
me has ever been upright and honourable&mdash;a
friend to a friend&mdash;a brother to a sister&mdash;could
not, in all he has done and said, have been more
respectful, more anxiously affectionate, more undeviatingly
candid. In our frequent interviews
and intercourse he has indeed seemed very kind&mdash;very
attached. But had I been disposed&mdash;at
times I may have been too much so&mdash;to listen to
him with endurance,"&mdash;the young lady here put
her hand on her forehead, but the tears streamed
through her slender fingers,&mdash;"he has never spoken
of any love&mdash;any preference;&mdash;if he indeed entertains
any, some obstacle, insurmountable on his
part, has interfered to prevent him."</p>

<p>"Obstacle?" replied the Swiss damsel. "Ay,
doubtless&mdash;some childish bashfulness&mdash;some foolish
idea about your birth being so high above his
own&mdash;some dream of modesty pushed to extremity,
which considers as impenetrable the ice of a
spring frost. This delusion may be broken by a
moment's encouragement, and I will take the task
on myself, to spare your blushes, my dearest
Anne."</p>

<p>"No, no; for Heaven's sake, no, Veilchen!"
answered the Baroness, to whom Annette had so
long been a companion and confidant, rather than
a domestic. "You cannot anticipate the nature of
the obstacles which may prevent his thinking on
what you are so desirous to promote. Hear me&mdash;My
early education, and the instructions of my
kind uncle, have taught me to know something
more of foreigners and their fashions than I ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
could have learned in our happy retirement of
Geierstein; I am well-nigh convinced that these
Philipsons are of rank, as they are of manners and
bearing, far superior to the occupation which they
appear to hold. The father is a man of deep observation,
of high thought and pretension, and lavish
of gifts, far beyond what consists with the utmost
liberality of a trader."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Annette. "I will say for
myself, that the silver chain he gave me weighs
against ten silver crowns, and the cross which
Arthur added to it, the day after the long ride we
had together up towards Mount Pilatus, is worth,
they tell me, as much more. There is not the
like of it in the Cantons. Well, what then? They
are rich, so are you. So much the better."</p>

<p>"Alas! Annette, they are not only rich, but
noble. I am persuaded of this; for I have observed
often, that even the father retreated, with
an air of quiet and dignified contempt, from discussions
with Donnerhugel and others, who, in
our plain way, wished to fasten a dispute upon
him. And when a rude observation or blunt
pleasantry was pointed at the son, his eye flashed,
his cheek coloured, and it was only a glance from
his father which induced him to repress the retort
of no friendly character which rose to his lips."</p>

<p>"You have been a close observer," said Annette.
"All this may be true, but I noted it not. But
what then, I say once more? If Arthur has some
fine noble name in his own country, are not you
yourself Baroness of Arnheim? And I will
frankly allow it as something of worth, if it
smooths the way to a match, where I think you
must look for happiness&mdash;I hope so, else I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
am sure it should have no encouragement from
me."</p>

<p>"I do believe so, my faithful Veilchen; but,
alas! how can you, in the state of natural freedom
in which you have been bred, know, or even
dream, of the various restraints which this gilded
or golden chain of rank and nobility hangs upon
those whom it fetters and encumbers, I fear, as
much as it decorates? In every country, the distinction
of rank binds men to certain duties. It
may carry with it restrictions, which may prevent
alliances in foreign countries&mdash;it often may prevent
them from consulting their inclinations,
when they wed in their own. It leads to alliances
in which the heart is never consulted, to treaties
of marriage, which are often formed when the
parties are in the cradle, or in leading strings, but
which are not the less binding on them in honour
and faith. Such may exist in the present case.
These alliances are often blended and mixed up
with state policy; and if the interest of England,
or what he deems such, should have occasioned
the elder Philipson to form such an engagement,
Arthur would break his own heart&mdash;the heart of
any one else&mdash;rather than make false his father's
word."</p>

<p>"The more shame to them that formed such an
engagement!" said Annette. "Well, they talk of
England being a free country; but if they can bar
young men and women of the natural privilege to
call their hands and hearts their own, I would as
soon be a German serf.&mdash;Well, lady, you are wise,
and I am ignorant. But what is to be done? I
have brought this young man here, expecting, God
knows, a happier issue to your meeting. But it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
is clear you cannot marry him without his asking
you. Now, although I confess that, if I could
think him willing to forfeit the hand of the fairest
maid of the Cantons, either from want of manly
courage to ask it, or from regard to some ridiculous
engagement, formed betwixt his father and
some other nobleman of their island of noblemen,
I would not in either case grudge him a ducking
in the moat; yet it is another question, whether
we should send him down to be murdered among
those cut-throats of the Rhinegrave; and unless
we do so, I know not how to get rid of him."</p>

<p>"Then let the boy William give attendance on
him here, and do you see to his accommodation.
It is best we do not meet."</p>

<p>"I will," said Annette; "yet what am I to say
for you? Unhappily, I let him know that you
were here."</p>

<p>"Alas, imprudent girl! Yet why should I
blame thee," said Anne of Geierstein, "when the
imprudence has been so great on my own side? It
is myself, who, suffering my imagination to rest
too long upon this young man and his merits,
have led me into this entanglement. But I will
show thee that I can overcome this folly, and I
will not seek in my own error a cause for evading
the duties of hospitality. Go, Veilchen, get some
refreshment ready. Thou shalt sup with us, and
thou must not leave us. Thou shalt see me behave
as becomes both a German lady and a Swiss
maiden. Get me first a candle, however, my girl,
for I must wash these tell-tales, my eyes, and
arrange my dress."</p>

<p>To Annette this whole explanation had been one
scene of astonishment, for, in the simple ideas of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
love and courtship in which she had been brought
up amid the Swiss mountains, she had expected
that the two lovers would have taken the first
opportunity of the absence of their natural guardians,
and have united themselves for ever; and
she had even arranged a little secondary plot, in
which she herself and Martin Sprenger, her faithful
bachelor, were to reside with the young couple
as friends and dependants. Silenced, therefore,
but not satisfied, by the objections of her young
mistress, the zealous Annette retreated murmuring
to herself,&mdash;"That little hint about her dress is
the only natural and sensible word she has said
in my hearing. Please God, I will return and help
her in the twinkling of an eye. That dressing my
mistress is the only part of a waiting-lady's life
that I have the least fancy for&mdash;it seems so natural
for one pretty maiden to set off another&mdash;in
faith we are but learning to dress ourselves at
another time."</p>

<p>And with this sage remark Annette Veilchen
tripped down stairs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Tell me not of it&mdash;I could ne'er abide</p>
<p>The mummery of all that forced civility.</p>
<p>"Pray, seat yourself, my lord." With cringing hams</p>
<p>The speech is spoken, and, with bended knee,</p>
<p>Heard by the smiling courtier.&mdash;"Before you, sir?</p>
<p>It must be on the earth then." Hang it all!</p>
<p>The pride which cloaks itself in such poor fashion</p>
<p>Is scarcely fit to swell a beggar's bosom.</p>
<p class="i12"><i>Old Play.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>Up stairs and down stairs tripped Annette Veilchen,
the soul of all that was going on in the only
habitable corner of the huge castle of Arnheim.
She was equal to every kind of service, and therefore
popped her head into the stable to be sure
that William attended properly to Arthur's horse,
looked into the kitchen to see that the old cook,
Marthon, roasted the partridges in due time (an
interference for which she received little thanks),
rummaged out a flask or two of Rhine wine from
the huge Dom Daniel of a cellar, and, finally, just
peeped into the parlour to see how Arthur was
looking; when, having the satisfaction to see he
had in the best manner he could sedulously arranged
his person, she assured him that he should
shortly see her mistress, who was rather indisposed,
yet could not refrain from coming down to
see so valued an acquaintance.</p>

<p>Arthur blushed when she spoke thus, and
seemed so handsome in the waiting-maid's eye,
that she could not help saying to herself, as she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
went to her young lady's room,&mdash;"Well, if true
love cannot manage to bring that couple together,
in spite of all the obstacles that they stand
boggling at, I will never believe that there is
such a thing as true love in the world, let Martin
Sprenger say what he will, and swear to it on
the Gospels."</p>

<p>When she reached the young Baroness's apartment,
she found, to her surprise, that, instead of
having put on what finery she possessed, that
young lady's choice had preferred the same simple
kirtle which she had worn during the first day
that Arthur had dined at Geierstein. Annette
looked at first puzzled and doubtful, then suddenly
recognised the good taste which had dictated the
attire, and exclaimed,&mdash;"You are right&mdash;you are
right&mdash;it is best to meet him as a free-hearted
Swiss maiden."</p>

<p>Anne also smiled as she replied,&mdash;"But, at the
same time, in the walls of Arnheim, I must appear
in some respect as the daughter of my father.&mdash;Here,
girl, aid me to put this gem upon the riband
which binds my hair."</p>

<p>It was an aigrette, or plume, composed of two
feathers of a vulture, fastened together by an opal,
which changed to the changing light with a variability
which enchanted the Swiss damsel, who had
never seen anything resembling it in her life.</p>

<p>"Now, Baroness Anne," said she, "if that pretty
thing be really worn as a sign of your rank, it is
the only thing belonging to your dignity that I
should ever think of coveting; for it doth shimmer
and change colour after a most wonderful
fashion, even something like one's own cheek
when one is fluttered."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>"Alas, Annette!" said the Baroness, passing
her hand across her eyes, "of all the gauds which
the females of my house have owned, this perhaps
hath been the most fatal to its possessors."</p>

<p>"And why then wear it?" said Annette. "Why
wear it now, of all days in the year?"</p>

<p>"Because it best reminds me of my duty to my
father and family. And now, girl, look thou sit
with us at table, and leave not the apartment;
and see thou fly not to and fro to help thyself or
others with anything on the board, but remain
quiet and seated till William helps you to what
you have occasion for."</p>

<p>"Well, that is a gentle fashion, which I like
well enough," said Annette, "and William serves
us so debonairly, that it is a joy to see him; yet,
ever and anon, I feel as I were not Annette Veilchen
herself, but only Annette Veilchen's picture,
since I can neither rise, sit down, run about, nor
stand still, without breaking some rule of courtly
breeding. It is not so, I dare say, with you, who
are always mannerly."</p>

<p>"Less courtly than thou seemest to think," said
the high-born maiden; "but I feel the restraint
more on the greensward, and under heaven's free
air, than when I undergo it closed within the
walls of an apartment."</p>

<p>"Ah, true&mdash;the dancing," said Annette; "that
was something to be sorry for indeed."</p>

<p>"But most am I sorry, Annette, that I cannot
tell whether I act precisely right or wrong in seeing
this young man, though it must be for the
last time. Were my father to arrive?&mdash;Were Ital
Schreckenwald to return"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your father is too deeply engaged on some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
his dark and mystic errands," said the flippant
Swiss; "sailed to the mountains of the Brockenberg,
where witches hold their sabbath, or gone on
a hunting-party with the Wild Huntsman."</p>

<p>"Fie, Annette, how dare you talk thus of my
father?"</p>

<p>"Why, I know little of him personally," said
the damsel, "and you yourself do not know much
more. And how should that be false which all
men say is true?"</p>

<p>"Why, fool, what do they say?"</p>

<p>"Why, that the Count is a wizard,&mdash;that your
grandmother was a will-of-wisp, and old Ital
Schreckenwald a born devil incarnate; and there
is some truth in that, whatever comes of the rest."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Gone down to spend the night in the village,
to see the Rhinegrave's men quartered, and keep
them in some order, if possible; for the soldiers
are disappointed of pay which they had been promised;
and when this happens, nothing resembles
a lanzknecht except a chafed bear."</p>

<p>"Go we down then, girl; it is perhaps the last
night which we may spend, for years, with a certain
degree of freedom."</p>

<p>I will not pretend to describe the marked
embarrassment with which Arthur Philipson and
Anne of Geierstein met; neither lifted their eyes,
neither spoke intelligibly, as they greeted each
other, and the maiden herself did not blush more
deeply than her modest visitor; while the good-humoured
Swiss girl, whose ideas of love partook
of the freedom of a more Arcadian country and
its customs, looked on with eyebrows a little
arched, much in wonder, and a little in contempt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
at a couple who, as she might think, acted with
such unnatural and constrained reserve. Deep
was the reverence and the blush with which
Arthur offered his hand to the young lady, and
her acceptance of the courtesy had the same character
of extreme bashfulness, agitation, and embarrassment.
In short, though little or nothing
intelligible passed between this very handsome
and interesting couple, the interview itself did not
on that account lose any interest. Arthur handed
the maiden, as was the duty of a gallant of the
day, into the next room, where their repast was
prepared; and Annette, who watched with singular
attention everything which occurred, felt with
astonishment that the forms and ceremonies of
the higher orders of society had such an influence,
even over her free-born mind, as the rites of the
Druids over that of the Roman general, when
he said,</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">I scorn them, yet they awe me.</p>
</div>
<p>"What can have changed them?" said Annette.
"When at Geierstein they looked but like another
girl and bachelor, only that Anne is so very handsome;
but now they move in time and manner as
if they were leading a stately pavin, and behave
to each other with as much formal respect as if he
were Landamman of the Unterwalden, and she the
first lady of Berne. 'Tis all very fine, doubtless, but
it is not the way that Martin Sprenger makes love."</p>

<p>Apparently, the circumstances in which each of
the young people was placed recalled to them the
habits of lofty and somewhat formal courtesy to
which they might have been accustomed in former
days; and while the Baroness felt it necessary to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
observe the strictest decorum, in order to qualify
the reception of Arthur into the interior of her
retreat, he, on the other hand, endeavoured to
show, by the profoundness of his respect, that he
was incapable of misusing the kindness with
which he had been treated. They placed themselves
at table, scrupulously observing the distance
which might become a "virtuous gentleman and
maid." The youth William did the service of
the entertainment with deftness and courtesy, as
one well accustomed to such duty; and Annette,
placing herself between them, and endeavouring,
as closely as she could, to adhere to the ceremonies
which she saw them observe, made practice of the
civilities which were expected from the attendant
of a baroness. Various, however, were the errors
which she committed. Her demeanour in general
was that of a greyhound in the slips, ready to start
up every moment; and she was only withheld by
the recollection that she was to ask for that which
she had far more mind to help herself to.</p>

<p>Other points of etiquette were transgressed in
their turn, after the repast was over, and the attendant
had retired. The waiting damsel often
mingled too unceremoniously in the conversation,
and could not help calling her mistress by her
Christian name of Anne, and, in defiance of all
decorum, addressed her, as well as Philipson, with
the pronoun <i>thou</i>, which then, as well as now, was
a dreadful solecism in German politeness. Her
blunders were so far fortunate that, by furnishing
the young lady and Arthur with a topic foreign
to the peculiarities of their own situation, they
enabled them to withdraw their attentions from
its embarrassments, and to exchange smiles at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
poor Annette's expense. She was not long of perceiving
this, and half nettled, half availing herself
of the apology to speak her mind, said, with considerable
spirit, "You have both been very merry,
forsooth, at my expense, and all because I wished
rather to rise and seek what I wanted, than wait
till the poor fellow, who was kept trotting between
the board and beauffet, found leisure to bring it to
me. You laugh at me now, because I call you by
your names, as they were given to you in the
blessed church at your christening; and because I
say to you <i>thee</i> and <i>thou</i>, addressing my Juncker
and my Yungfrau as I would do if I were on my
knees praying to Heaven. But for all your new-world
fancies, I can tell you, you are but a couple
of children, who do not know your own minds,
and are jesting away the only leisure given you to
provide for your own happiness. Nay, frown not,
my sweet Mistress Baroness; I have looked at
Mount Pilatus too often, to fear a gloomy brow."</p>

<p>"Peace, Annette," said her mistress, "or quit
the room."</p>

<p>"Were I not more your friend than I am my
own," said the headstrong and undaunted Annette,
"I would quit the room, and the castle to boot,
and leave you to hold your house here, with your
amiable seneschal, Ital Schreckenwald."</p>

<p>"If not for love, yet for shame, for charity, be
silent, or leave the room."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Annette, "my bolt is shot, and I
have but hinted at what all upon Geierstein Green
said, the night when the bow of Buttisholz was
bended. You know what the old saw says"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Peace! peace, for Heaven's sake, or I must
needs fly!" said the young Baroness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay, then," said Annette, considerably changing
her tone, as if afraid that her mistress should
actually retire, "if you must fly, necessity must
have its course. I know no one who can follow.
This mistress of mine, Seignor Arthur, would require
for her attendant, not a homely girl of flesh
and blood like myself, but a waiting-woman with
substance composed of gossamer, and breath supplied
by the spirit of ether. Would you believe
it&mdash;It is seriously held by many, that she partakes
of the race of spirits of the elements, which
makes her so much more bashful than maidens of
this every-day world."</p>

<p>Anne of Geierstein seemed rather glad to lead
away the conversation from the turn which her
wayward maiden had given to it, and to turn it on
more indifferent subjects, though these were still
personal to herself.</p>

<p>"Seignor Arthur," she said, "thinks, perhaps,
he has some room to nourish some such strange
suspicion as your heedless folly expresses, and
some fools believe, both in Germany and Switzerland.
Confess, Seignor Arthur, you thought
strangely of me when I passed your guard upon
the bridge of Graffs-lust, on the night last past."</p>

<p>The recollection of the circumstances which had
so greatly surprised him at the time so startled
Arthur that it was with some difficulty he commanded
himself, so as to attempt an answer at all;
and what he did say on the occasion was broken
and unconnected.</p>

<p>"I did hear, I own&mdash;that is, Rudolph Donnerhugel
reported&mdash;But that I believed that you, gentle
lady, were other than a Christian maiden"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nay, if Rudolph were the reporter," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Annette, "you would hear the worst of my lady
and her lineage, that is certain. He is one of
those prudent personages who depreciate and find
fault with the goods he has thoughts of purchasing,
in order to deter other offerers. Yes, he told you
a fine goblin story, I warrant you, of my lady's
grandmother; and truly, it so happened, that
the circumstances of the case gave, I dare say,
some colour in your eyes to"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not so, Annette," answered Arthur; "whatever
might be said of your lady that sounded uncouth
and strange, fell to the ground as incredible."</p>

<p>"Not quite so much so, I fancy," interrupted
Annette, without heeding sign or frown. "I
strongly suspect I should have had much more
trouble in dragging you hither to this castle, had
you known you were approaching the haunt of the
Nymph of the Fire, the Salamander, as they call
her, not to mention the shock of again seeing the
descendant of that Maiden of the Fiery Mantle."</p>

<p>"Peace, once more, Annette," said her mistress;
"since Fate has occasioned this meeting, let us
not neglect the opportunity to disabuse our English
friend of the absurd report he has listened to,
with doubt and wonder perhaps, but not with
absolute incredulity.</p>

<p>"Seignor Arthur Philipson," she proceeded, "it
is true my grandfather, by the mother's side,
Baron Herman of Arnheim, was a man of great
knowledge in abstruse sciences. He was also a
presiding judge of a tribunal of which you must
have heard, called the Holy Vehme. One night
a stranger, closely pursued by the agents of that
body, which" (crossing herself) "it is not safe even
to name, arrived at the castle and craved his protection,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
and the rights of hospitality. My grandfather,
finding the advance which the stranger had
made to the rank of Adept, gave him his protection,
and became bail to deliver him to answer the
charge against him, for a year and a day, which
delay he was, it seems, entitled to require on his
behalf. They studied together during that term,
and pushed their researches into the mysteries of
nature, as far, in all probability, as men have the
power of urging them. When the fatal day drew
nigh on which the guest must part from his host,
he asked permission to bring his daughter to the
castle, that they might exchange a last farewell.
She was introduced with much secrecy, and after
some days, finding that her father's fate was so uncertain,
the Baron, with the sage's consent, agreed
to give the forlorn maiden refuge in his castle,
hoping to obtain from her some additional information
concerning the languages and the wisdom
of the East. Dannischemend, her father, left this
castle, to go to render himself up to the Vehme-gericht
at Fulda. The result is unknown; perhaps
he was saved by Baron Arnheim's testimony,
perhaps he was given up to the steel and the cord.
On such matters, who dare speak?</p>

<p>"The fair Persian became the wife of her guardian
and protector. Amid many excellences, she
had one peculiarity allied to imprudence. She
availed herself of her foreign dress and manners,
as well as of a beauty which was said to have been
marvellous, and an agility seldom equalled, to
impose upon and terrify the ignorant German
ladies, who, hearing her speak Persian and Arabic,
were already disposed to consider her as over
closely connected with unlawful arts. She was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
of a fanciful and imaginative disposition, and
delighted to place herself in such colours and circumstances
as might confirm their most ridiculous
suspicions, which she considered only as matter of
sport. There was no end to the stories to which
she gave rise. Her first appearance in the castle
was said to be highly picturesque, and to have
inferred something of the marvellous. With the
levity of a child, she had some childish passions,
and while she encouraged the growth and circulation
of the most extraordinary legends amongst
some of the neighbourhood, she entered into disputes
with persons of her own quality concerning
rank and precedence, on which the ladies of
Westphalia have at all times set great store. This
cost her her life; for, on the morning of the christening
of my poor mother, the Baroness of Arnheim
died suddenly, even while a splendid company
was assembled in the castle chapel to witness
the ceremony. It was believed that she died of
poison, administered by the Baroness Steinfeldt,
with whom she was engaged in a bitter quarrel,
entered into chiefly on behalf of her friend and
companion, the Countess Waldstetten."</p>

<p>"And the opal gem?&mdash;and the sprinkling with
water?" said Arthur Philipson.</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied the young Baroness, "I see you
desire to hear the real truth of my family history,
of which you have yet learned only the romantic
legend.&mdash;The sprinkling of water was necessarily
had recourse to, on my ancestress's first swoon.
As for the opal, I have heard that it did indeed
grow pale, but only because it is said to be the
nature of that noble gem, on the approach of
poison. Some part of the quarrel with the Baroness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Steinfeldt was about the right of the Persian
maiden to wear this stone, which an ancestor of
my family won in battle from the Soldan of Trebizond.
All these things were confused in popular
tradition, and the real facts turned into a fairy
tale."</p>

<p>"But you have said nothing," suggested Arthur
Philipson, "on&mdash;on"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"On what?" said his hostess.</p>

<p>"On your appearance last night."</p>

<p>"Is it possible," said she, "that a man of sense,
and an Englishman, cannot guess at the explanation
which I have to give, though not, perhaps,
very distinctly? My father, you are aware, has
been a busy man in a disturbed country, and has
incurred the hatred of many powerful persons.
He is, therefore, obliged to move in secret, and
avoid unnecessary observation. He was, besides,
averse to meet his brother, the Landamman. I
was therefore told, on our entering Germany, that
I was to expect a signal where and when to join
him,&mdash;the token was to be a small crucifix of
bronze, which had belonged to my poor mother.
In my apartment at Graffs-lust I found the token,
with a note from my father, making me acquainted
with a secret passage proper to such
places, which, though it had the appearance of
being blocked up, was in fact very slightly barricaded.
By this I was instructed to pass to the
gate, make my escape into the woods, and meet
my father at a place appointed there."</p>

<p>"A wild and perilous adventure," said Arthur.</p>

<p>"I have never been so much shocked," continued
the maiden, "as at receiving this summons,
compelling me to steal away from my kind and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
affectionate uncle, and go I knew not whither.
Yet compliance was absolutely necessary. The
place of meeting was plainly pointed out. A
midnight walk, in the neighbourhood of protection,
was to me a trifle; but the precaution of
posting sentinels at the gate might have interfered
with my purpose, had I not mentioned it to some
of my elder cousins, the Biedermans, who readily
agreed to let me pass and repass unquestioned.
But you know my cousins; honest and kind-hearted,
they are of a rude way of thinking, and
as incapable of feeling a generous delicacy as&mdash;some
other persons."&mdash;(Here there was a glance
towards Annette Veilchen.)&mdash;"They exacted from
me, that I should conceal myself and my purpose
from Sigismund; and as they are always making
sport with the simple youth, they insisted that I
should pass him in such a manner as might induce
him to believe that I was a spiritual apparition,
and out of his terrors for supernatural beings they
expected to have much amusement. I was obliged
to secure their connivance at my escape on their
own terms; and, indeed, I was too much grieved
at the prospect of quitting my kind uncle to
think much of anything else. Yet my surprise
was considerable, when, contrary to expectation,
I found you on the bridge as sentinel, instead of
my cousin Sigismund. Your own ideas I ask
not for."</p>

<p>"They were those of a fool," said Arthur, "of
a thrice-sodden fool. Had I been aught else, I
would have offered my escort. My sword"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I could not have accepted your protection,"
said Anne, calmly. "My mission was in every
respect a secret one. I met my father&mdash;some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
intercourse had taken place betwixt him and
Rudolph Donnerhugel, which induced him to
alter his purpose of carrying me away with him
last night. I joined him, however, early this
morning, while Annette acted for a time my
part amongst the Swiss pilgrims. My father
desired that it should not be known when or
with whom I left my uncle and his escort. I
need scarce remind you, that I saw you in the
dungeon."</p>

<p>"You were the preserver of my life," said the
youth,&mdash;"the restorer of my liberty."</p>

<p>"Ask me not the reason of my silence. I was
then acting under the agency of others, not under
mine own. Your escape was effected, in order to
establish a communication betwixt the Swiss without
the fortress and the soldiers within. After
the alarm at La Ferette, I learned from Sigismund
Biederman that a party of banditti were pursuing
your father and you, with a view to pillage and
robbery. My father had furnished me with the
means of changing Anne of Geierstein into a
German maiden of quality. I set out instantly,
and glad I am to have given you a hint which
might free you from danger."</p>

<p>"But my father?" said Arthur.</p>

<p>"I have every reason to hope he is well and
safe," answered the young lady. "More than I
were eager to protect both you and him&mdash;poor
Sigismund amongst the first.&mdash;And now, my
friend, these mysteries explained, it is time we
part, and for ever."</p>

<p>"Part!&mdash;and for ever!" repeated the youth, in
a voice like a dying echo.</p>

<p>"It is our fate," said the maiden. "I appeal to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
you if it is not your duty&mdash;I tell you it is mine.
You will depart with early dawn to Strasburg&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;we
never meet again."</p>

<p>With an ardour of passion which he could not
repress, Arthur Philipson threw himself at the
feet of the maiden, whose faltering tone had
clearly expressed that she felt deeply in uttering
the words. She looked round for Annette, but
Annette had disappeared at this most critical moment;
and her mistress for a second or two was not
perhaps sorry for her absence.</p>

<p>"Rise," she said, "Arthur&mdash;rise. You must
not give way to feelings that might be fatal to
yourself and me."</p>

<p>"Hear me, lady, before I bid you adieu, and for
ever&mdash;the word of a criminal is heard, though he
plead the worst cause&mdash;I am a belted knight, and
the son and heir of an Earl, whose name has been
spread throughout England and France, and wherever
valour has had fame."</p>

<p>"Alas!" said she, faintly, "I have but too long
suspected what you now tell me&mdash;Rise, I pray
you, rise."</p>

<p>"Never till you hear me," said the youth,
seizing one of her hands, which trembled, but
hardly could be said to struggle in his grasp.&mdash;"Hear
me," he said, with the enthusiasm of first
love, when the obstacles of bashfulness and diffidence
are surmounted,&mdash;"My father and I are&mdash;I
acknowledge it&mdash;bound on a most hazardous and
doubtful expedition. You will very soon learn its
issue for good or bad. If it succeed, you shall hear
of me in my own character&mdash;If I fall, I must&mdash;I
will&mdash;I do claim a tear from Anne of Geierstein.
If I escape, I have yet a horse, a lance, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
sword; and you shall hear nobly of him whom you
have thrice protected from imminent danger."</p>

<p>"Arise&mdash;arise," repeated the maiden, whose
tears began to flow fast, as, struggling to raise her
lover, they fell thick upon his head and face. "I
have heard enough&mdash;to listen to more were indeed
madness, both for you and myself."</p>

<p>"Yet one single word," added the youth;
"while Arthur has a heart, it beats for you&mdash;while
Arthur can wield an arm, it strikes for you,
and in your cause."</p>

<p>Annette now rushed into the room.</p>

<p>"Away, away!" she cried&mdash;"Schreckenwald
has returned from the village with some horrible
tidings, and I fear me he comes this way."</p>

<p>Arthur had started to his feet at the first signal
of alarm.</p>

<p>"If there is danger near your lady, Annette,
there is at least one faithful friend by her side."</p>

<p>Annette looked anxiously at her mistress.</p>

<p>"But Schreckenwald," she said&mdash;"Schreckenwald,
your father's steward&mdash;his confidant.&mdash;Oh,
think better of it&mdash;I can hide Arthur somewhere."</p>

<p>The noble-minded girl had already resumed her
composure, and replied with dignity,&mdash;"I have
done nothing," she said, "to offend my father. If
Schreckenwald be my father's steward, he is my
vassal. I hide no guest to conciliate him. Sit
down" (addressing Arthur), "and let us receive
this man.&mdash;Introduce him instantly, Annette,
and let us hear his tidings&mdash;and bid him remember,
that when he speaks to me he addresses his
mistress."</p>

<p>Arthur resumed his seat, still more proud of his
choice from the noble and fearless spirit displayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
by one who had so lately shown herself sensible
to the gentlest feelings of the female sex.</p>

<p>Annette, assuming courage from her mistress's
dauntless demeanour, clapped her hands together
as she left the room, saying, but in a low voice,
"I see that after all it is something to be a Baroness,
if one can assert her dignity conformingly.
How could I be so much frightened for this rude
man!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i8">Affairs that walk</p>
<p>(As they say spirits do) at midnight, have</p>
<p>In them a wilder nature than the business</p>
<p>That seeks dispatch by day.</p>

<p class="i7"><i>Henry VIII. Act V.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The approach of the steward was now boldly expected
by the little party. Arthur, flattered at
once and elevated by the firmness which Anne had
shown when this person's arrival was announced,
hastily considered the part which he was to act
in the approaching scene, and prudently determined
to avoid all active and personal interference,
till he should observe from the demeanour
of Anne that such was likely to be useful or agreeable
to her. He resumed his place, therefore, at
a distant part of the board, on which their meal
had been lately spread, and remained there, determined
to act in the manner Anne's behaviour
should suggest as most prudent and fitting,&mdash;veiling,
at the same time, the most acute internal
anxiety, by an appearance of that deferential composure,
which one of inferior rank adopts when
admitted to the presence of a superior. Anne, on
her part, seemed to prepare herself for an interview
of interest. An air of conscious dignity
succeeded the extreme agitation which she had so
lately displayed, and, busying herself with some
articles of female work, she also seemed to expect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
with tranquillity the visit to which her attendant
was disposed to attach so much alarm.</p>

<p>A step was heard upon the stair, hurried and
unequal, as that of some one in confusion as well
as haste; the door flew open, and Ital Schreckenwald
entered.</p>

<p>This person, with whom the details given to
the elder Philipson by the Landamman Biederman
have made the reader in some degree acquainted,
was a tall, well-made, soldierly looking man.
His dress, like that of persons of rank at the
period in Germany, was more varied in colour,
more cut and ornamented, slashed and jagged, than
the habit worn in France and England. The
never-failing hawk's feather decked his cap,
secured with a medal of gold, which served as a
clasp. His doublet was of buff, for defence, but
<i>laid down</i>, as it was called in the tailor's craft,
with rich lace on each seam, and displaying on
the breast a golden chain, the emblem of his rank
in the Baron's household. He entered with rather
a hasty step, and busy and offended look, and
said, somewhat rudely, "Why, how now, young
lady&mdash;wherefore this? Strangers in the castle at
this period of night!"</p>

<p>Anne of Geierstein, though she had been long
absent from her native country, was not ignorant
of its habits and customs, and knew the haughty
manner in which all who were noble exerted their
authority over their dependants.</p>

<p>"Are you a vassal of Arnheim, Ital Schreckenwald,
and do you speak to the Lady of Arnheim
in her own castle with an elevated voice, a saucy
look, and bonneted withal? Know your place;
and, when you have demanded pardon for your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
insolence, and told your errand in such terms as
befit your condition and mine, I may listen to
what you have to say."</p>

<p>Schreckenwald's hand, in spite of him, stole to
his bonnet, and uncovered his haughty brow.</p>

<p>"Noble lady," he said, in a somewhat milder
tone, "excuse me if my haste be unmannerly, but
the alarm is instant. The soldiery of the Rhinegrave
have mutinied, plucked down the banners of
their master, and set up an independent ensign,
which they call the pennon of St. Nicholas, under
which they declare that they will maintain peace
with God, and war with all the world. This
castle cannot escape them, when they consider that
the first course to maintain themselves must be to
take possession of some place of strength. You
must up then, and ride with the very peep of
dawn. For the present, they are busy with the
wine-skins of the peasants, but when they wake
in the morning they will unquestionably march
hither; and you may chance to fall into the hands
of those who will think of the terrors of the castle
of Arnheim as the figments of a fairy tale, and
laugh at its mistress's pretensions to honour and
respect."</p>

<p>"Is it impossible to make resistance? The
castle is strong," said the young lady, "and I am
unwilling to leave the house of my fathers without
attempting somewhat in our defence."</p>

<p>"Five hundred men," said Schreckenwald,
"might garrison Arnheim, battlement and tower.
With a less number it were madness to attempt to
keep such an extent of walls; and how to get
twenty soldiers together, I am sure I know not.&mdash;So,
having now the truth of the story, let me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
beseech you to dismiss this guest,&mdash;too young, I
think, to be the inmate of a lady's bower,&mdash;and
I will point to him the nighest way out of the
castle; for this is a strait in which we must all
be contented with looking to our own safety."</p>

<p>"And whither is it that you propose to go?"
said the Baroness, continuing to maintain, in
respect to Ital Schreckenwald, the complete and
calm assertion of absolute superiority, to which the
seneschal gave way with such marks of impatience
as a fiery steed exhibits under the management of
a complete cavalier.</p>

<p>"To Strasburg, I propose to go,&mdash;that is, if it
so please you,&mdash;with such slight escort as I can
get hastily together by daybreak. I trust we may
escape being observed by the mutineers; or, if we
fall in with a party of stragglers, I apprehend but
little difficulty in forcing my way."</p>

<p>"And wherefore do you prefer Strasburg as a
place of asylum?"</p>

<p>"Because I trust we shall there meet your
excellency's father, the noble Count Albert of
Geierstein."</p>

<p>"It is well," said the young lady.&mdash;"You also,
I think, Seignor Philipson, spoke of directing your
course to Strasburg. If it consist with your convenience,
you may avail yourself of the protection
of my escort as far as that city, where you expect
to meet your father."</p>

<p>It will readily be believed that Arthur cheerfully
bowed assent to a proposal which was to
prolong their remaining in society together, and
might possibly, as his romantic imagination suggested,
afford him an opportunity, on a road beset
with dangers, to render some service of importance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>Ital Schreckenwald attempted to remonstrate.</p>

<p>"Lady!&mdash;lady!"&mdash;he said, with some marks
of impatience.</p>

<p>"Take breath and leisure, Schreckenwald," said
Anne, "and you will be more able to express
yourself with distinctness, and with respectful
propriety."</p>

<p>The impatient vassal muttered an oath betwixt
his teeth, and answered with forced civility,&mdash;"Permit
me to state, that our case requires we
should charge ourselves with the care of no one but
you. We shall be few enough for your defence,
and I cannot permit any stranger to travel with
us."</p>

<p>"If," said Arthur, "I conceived that I was to
be a useless incumbrance on the retreat of this
noble young lady, worlds, Sir Squire, would not
induce me to accept her offer. But I am neither
child nor woman&mdash;I am a full-grown man, and
ready to show such good service as manhood may
in defence of your lady."</p>

<p>"If we must not challenge your valour and
ability, young sir," said Schreckenwald, "who
shall answer for your fidelity?"</p>

<p>"To question that elsewhere," said Arthur,
"might be dangerous."</p>

<p>But Anne interfered between them. "We must
straight to rest, and remain prompt for alarm, perhaps
even before the hour of dawn. Schreckenwald,
I trust to your care for due watch and ward.&mdash;You
have men enough at least for that purpose.&mdash;And
hear and mark&mdash;It is my desire and command,
that this gentleman be accommodated with
lodgings here for this night, and that he travel
with us to-morrow. For this I will be responsible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
to my father, and your part is only to obey
my commands. I have long had occasion to know
both the young man's father and himself, who
were ancient guests of my uncle, the Landamman.
On the journey you will keep the youth beside
you, and use such courtesy to him as your rugged
temper will permit."</p>

<p>Ital Schreckenwald intimated his acquiescence
with a look of bitterness, which it were vain to
attempt to describe. It expressed spite, mortification,
humbled pride, and reluctant submission.
He did submit, however, and ushered young
Philipson into a decent apartment with a bed,
which the fatigue and agitation of the preceding
day rendered very acceptable.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the ardour with which Arthur
expected the rise of the next dawn, his deep repose,
the fruit of fatigue, held him until the reddening
of the east, when the voice of Schreckenwald exclaimed,
"Up, Sir Englishman, if you mean to
accomplish your boast of loyal service. It is time
we were in the saddle, and we shall tarry for no
sluggards."</p>

<p>Arthur was on the floor of the apartment, and
dressed, in almost an instant, not forgetting to put
on his shirt of mail, and assume whatever weapons
seemed most fit to render him an efficient part of
the convoy. He next hastened to seek out the
stable, to have his horse in readiness; and descending
for that purpose into the under story of the
lower mass of buildings, he was wandering in
search of the way which led to the offices, when
the voice of Annette Veilchen softly whispered,
"This way, Seignor Philipson; I would speak
with you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>The Swiss maiden, at the same time, beckoned
him into a small room, where he found her alone.</p>

<p>"Were you not surprised," she said, "to see my
lady queen it so over Ital Schreckenwald, who
keeps every other person in awe with his stern
looks and cross words? But the air of command
seems so natural to her, that, instead of being a
baroness, she might have been an empress. It
must come of birth, I think, after all, for I tried
last night to take state upon me, after the fashion
of my mistress, and, would you think it, the brute
Schreckenwald threatened to throw me out of the
window? But if ever I see Martin Sprenger again,
I'll know if there is strength in a Swiss arm, and
virtue in a Swiss quarter-staff.&mdash;But here I stand
prating, and my lady wishes to see you for a minute
ere we take to horse."</p>

<p>"Your lady?" said Arthur, starting. "Why
did you lose an instant? why not tell me before?"</p>

<p>"Because I was only to keep you here till she
came, and&mdash;here she is."</p>

<p>Anne of Geierstein entered, fully attired for her
journey. Annette, always willing to do as she
would wish to be done by, was about to leave the
apartment, when her mistress, who had apparently
made up her mind concerning what she had to do
or say, commanded her positively to remain.</p>

<p>"I am sure," she said, "Seignor Philipson will
rightly understand the feelings of hospitality&mdash;I
will say of friendship&mdash;which prevented my
suffering him to be expelled from my castle last
night, and which have determined me this morning
to admit of his company on the somewhat dangerous
road to Strasburg. At the gate of that town
we part, I to join my father, you to place yourself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
under the direction of yours. From that moment
intercourse between us ends, and our remembrance
of each other must be as the thoughts which we
pay to friends deceased."</p>

<p>"Tender recollections," said Arthur, passionately,
"more dear to our bosoms than all we have
surviving upon earth."</p>

<p>"Not a word in that tone," answered the
maiden. "With night delusion should end, and
reason awaken with dawning. One word more&mdash;Do
not address me on the road; you may, by doing
so, expose me to vexatious and insulting suspicion,
and yourself to quarrels and peril.&mdash;Farewell, our
party is ready to take horse."</p>

<p>She left the apartment, where Arthur remained
for a moment deeply bewildered in grief and disappointment.
The patience, nay, even favour,
with which Anne of Geierstein had, on the previous
night, listened to his passion, had not prepared
him for the terms of reserve and distance
which she now adopted towards him. He was
ignorant that noble maids, if feeling or passion
has for a moment swayed them from the strict
path of principle and duty, endeavour to atone for
it by instantly returning, and severely adhering,
to the line from which they have made a momentary
departure. He looked mournfully on Annette,
who, as she had been in the room before Anne's
arrival, took the privilege of remaining a minute
after her departure; but he read no comfort in
the glances of the confidant, who seemed as much
disconcerted as himself.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine what hath happened to her,"
said Annette; "to me she is kind as ever, but to
every other person about her she plays countess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
and baroness with a witness; and now she is
begun to tyrannise over her own natural feelings&mdash;and&mdash;if
this be greatness, Annette Veilchen
trusts always to remain the penniless Swiss girl;
she is mistress of her own freedom, and at liberty
to speak with her bachelor when she pleases, so as
religion and maiden modesty suffer nothing in the
conversation. Oh, a single daisy twisted with
content into one's hair, is worth all the opals in
India, if they bind us to torment ourselves and
other people, or hinder us from speaking our mind,
when our heart is upon our tongue. But never
fear, Arthur; for if she has the cruelty to think of
forgetting you, you may rely on one friend who,
while she has a tongue, and Anne has ears, will
make it impossible for her to do so."</p>

<p>So saying, away tripped Annette, having first
indicated to Philipson the passage by which he
would find the lower court of the castle. There
his steed stood ready, among about twenty others.
Twelve of these were accoutred with war saddles,
and frontlets of proof, being intended for the use
of as many cavaliers, or troopers, retainers of the
family of Arnheim, whom the seneschal's exertions
had been able to collect on the spur of the
occasion. Two palfreys, somewhat distinguished
by their trappings, were designed for Anne of
Geierstein and her favourite female attendant.
The other menials, chiefly boys and women servants,
had inferior horses. At a signal made, the
troopers took their lances and stood by their steeds,
till the females and menials were mounted and in
order; they then sprang into their saddles and
began to move forward, slowly and with great
precaution. Schreckenwald led the van, and kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Arthur Philipson close beside him. Anne and
her attendant were in the centre of the little
body, followed by the unwarlike train of servants,
while two or three experienced cavaliers brought
up the rear, with strict orders to guard against
surprise.</p>

<p>On their being put into motion, the first thing
which surprised Arthur was, that the horses' hoofs
no longer sent forth the sharp and ringing sound
arising from the collision of iron and flint, and as
the morning light increased he could perceive that
the fetlock and hoof of every steed, his own included,
had been carefully wrapped around with a
sufficient quantity of wool, to prevent the usual
noise which accompanied their motions. It was a
singular thing to behold the passage of the little
body of cavalry down the rocky road which led
from the castle, unattended with the noise which
we are disposed to consider as inseparable from
the motions of horse, the absence of which seemed
to give a peculiar and almost an unearthly appearance
to the cavalcade.</p>

<p>They passed in this manner the winding path
which led from the castle of Arnheim to the adjacent
village, which, as was the ancient feudal custom,
lay so near the fortress that its inhabitants,
when summoned by their lord, could instantly
repair for its defence. But it was at present occupied
by very different inhabitants, the mutinous
soldiers of the Rhinegrave. When the party from
Arnheim approached the entrance of the village,
Schreckenwald made a signal to halt, which was
instantly obeyed by his followers. He then rode
forward in person to reconnoitre, accompanied by
Arthur Philipson, both moving with the utmost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
steadiness and precaution. The deepest silence
prevailed in the deserted streets. Here and there
a soldier was seen, seemingly designed for a sentinel,
but uniformly fast asleep.</p>

<p>"The swinish mutineers!" said Schreckenwald;
"a fair night-watch they keep, and a beautiful
morning's rouse would I treat them with, were
not the point to protect yonder peevish wench.&mdash;Halt
thou here, stranger, while I ride back and
bring them on&mdash;there is no danger."</p>

<p>Schreckenwald left Arthur as he spoke, who,
alone in the street of a village filled with banditti,
though they were lulled into temporary insensibility,
had no reason to consider his case as very
comfortable. The chorus of a wassel song, which
some reveller was trolling over in his sleep; or, in
its turn, the growling of some village cur, seemed
the signal for an hundred ruffians to start up
around him. But in the space of two or three
minutes, the noiseless cavalcade, headed by Ital
Schreckenwald, again joined him, and followed
their leader, observing the utmost precaution not
to give an alarm. All went well till they reached
the farther end of the village, where, although the
Baaren-hauter<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
 who kept guard was as drunk as
his companions on duty, a large shaggy dog which
lay beside him was more vigilant. As the little
troop approached, the animal sent forth a ferocious
yell, loud enough to have broken the rest of the
Seven Sleepers, and which effectually dispelled
the slumbers of its master. The soldier snatched
up his carabine and fired, he knew not well at
what, or for what reason. The ball, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
struck Arthur's horse under him, and, as the animal
fell, the sentinel rushed forward to kill or
make prisoner the rider.</p>

<p>"Haste on, haste on, men of Arnheim! care for
nothing but the young lady's safety," exclaimed
the leader of the band.</p>

<p>"Stay, I command you;&mdash;aid the stranger, on
your lives!"&mdash;said Anne, in a voice which,
usually gentle and meek, she now made heard by
those around her, like the note of a silver clarion.
"I will not stir till he is rescued."</p>

<p>Schreckenwald had already spurred his horse for
flight; but, perceiving Anne's reluctance to follow
him, he dashed back, and seizing a horse which,
bridled and saddled, stood picketed near him, he
threw the reins to Arthur Philipson; and pushing
his own horse, at the same time, betwixt the Englishman
and the soldier, he forced the latter to
quit the hold he had on his person. In an instant
Philipson was again mounted, when, seizing a
battle-axe which hung at the saddle-bow of his
new steed, he struck down the staggering sentinel,
who was endeavouring again to seize upon him.
The whole troop then rode off at a gallop, for the
alarm began to grow general in the village; some
soldiers were seen coming out of their quarters,
and others were beginning to get upon horseback.
Before Schreckenwald and his party had ridden
a mile, they heard more than once the sound of
bugles; and when they arrived upon the summit
of an eminence commanding a view of the village,
their leader, who, during the retreat, had placed
himself in the rear of his company, now halted to
reconnoitre the enemy they had left behind them.
There was bustle and confusion in the street, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
there did not appear to be any pursuit; so that
Schreckenwald followed his route down the river,
with speed and activity indeed, but with so much
steadiness, at the same time, as not to distress the
slowest horse of his party.</p>

<p>When they had ridden two hours and more, the
confidence of their leader was so much augmented,
that he ventured to command a halt at the edge of
a pleasant grove, which served to conceal their
number, whilst both riders and horses took some
refreshment, for which purpose forage and provisions
had been borne along with them. Ital
Schreckenwald, having held some communication
with the Baroness, continued to offer their travelling
companion a sort of surly civility. He invited
him to partake of his own mess, which was
indeed little different from that which was served
out to the other troopers, but was seasoned with a
glass of wine from a more choice flask.</p>

<p>"To your health, brother," he said; "if you tell
this day's story truly, you will allow that I was
a true comrade to you two hours since, in riding
through the village of Arnheim."</p>

<p>"I will never deny it, fair sir," said Philipson,
"and I return you thanks for your timely assistance;
alike, whether it sprang from your mistress's
order, or your own good-will."</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! my friend," said Schreckenwald,
laughing, "you are a philosopher, and can try
conclusions while your horse lies rolling above
you, and a Baaren-hauter aims his sword at your
throat?&mdash;Well, since your wit hath discovered so
much, I care not if you know, that I should not
have had much scruple to sacrifice twenty such
smooth-faced gentlemen as yourself, rather than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
the young Baroness of Arnheim had incurred the
slightest danger."</p>

<p>"The propriety of the sentiment," said Philipson,
"is so undoubtedly correct, that I subscribe
to it, even though it is something discourteously
expressed towards myself."</p>

<p>In making this reply, the young man, provoked
at the insolence of Schreckenwald's manner, raised
his voice a little. The circumstance did not escape
observation, for, on the instant, Annette Veilchen
stood before them, with her mistress's commands
on them both to speak in whispers, or rather to be
altogether silent.</p>

<p>"Say to your mistress that I am mute," said
Philipson.</p>

<p>"Our mistress, the Baroness, says," continued
Annette, with an emphasis on the title, to which
she began to ascribe some talismanic influence,&mdash;"the
Baroness, I tell you, says, that silence much
concerns our safety, for it were most hazardous to
draw upon this little fugitive party the notice of
any passengers who may pass along the road during
the necessary halt; and so, sirs, it is the Baroness's
request that you will continue the exercise
of your teeth as fast as you can, and forbear that
of your tongues till you are in a safer condition."</p>

<p>"My lady is wise," answered Ital Schreckenwald,
"and her maiden is witty. I drink, Mrs.
Annette, in a cup of Rudersheimer, to the continuance
of her sagacity, and of your amiable liveliness
of disposition. Will it please you, fair
mistress, to pledge me in this generous liquor?"</p>

<p>"Out, thou German wine-flask!&mdash;Out, thou
eternal swill-flagon!&mdash;Heard you ever of a modest
maiden who drank wine before she had dined?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>"Remain without the generous inspiration then,"
said the German, "and nourish thy satirical vein
on sour cider or acid whey."</p>

<p>A short space having been allowed to refresh
themselves, the little party again mounted their
horses, and travelled with such speed, that long
before noon they arrived at the strongly fortified
town of Kehl, opposite to Strasburg, on the eastern
bank of the Rhine.</p>

<p>It is for local antiquaries to discover whether
the travellers crossed from Kehl to Strasburg by
the celebrated bridge of boats which at present
maintains the communication across the river, or
whether they were wafted over by some other mode
of transportation. It is enough that they passed
in safety, and had landed on the other side, where&mdash;whether
she dreaded that he might forget the
charge she had given him, that here they were to
separate, or whether she thought that something
more might be said in the moment of parting&mdash;the
young Baroness, before remounting her horse,
once more approached Arthur Philipson, who too
truly guessed the tenor of what she had to say.</p>

<p>"Gentle stranger," she said, "I must now bid
you farewell. But first let me ask if you know
whereabouts you are to seek your father?"</p>

<p>"In an inn called the Flying Stag," said Arthur,
dejectedly; "but where that is situated in this
large town, I know not."</p>

<p>"Do you know the place, Ital Schreckenwald?"</p>

<p>"I, young lady?&mdash;Not I&mdash;I know nothing of
Strasburg and its inns. I believe most of our
party are as ignorant as I am."</p>

<p>"You and they speak German, I suppose," said
the Baroness, drily, "and can make inquiry more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
easily than a foreigner? Go, sir, and forget not
that humanity to the stranger is a religious duty."</p>

<p>With that shrug of the shoulders which testifies
a displeased messenger, Ital went to make some
inquiry, and, in his absence, brief as it was, Anne
took an opportunity to say apart,&mdash;"Farewell!&mdash;Farewell!
Accept this token of friendship, and
wear it for my sake. May you be happy!"</p>

<p>Her slender fingers dropped into his hand a very
small parcel. He turned to thank her, but she
was already at some distance; and Schreckenwald,
who had taken his place by his side, said in his
harsh voice, "Come, Sir Squire, I have found out
your place of rendezvous, and I have but little time
to play the gentleman-usher."</p>

<p>He then rode on; and Philipson, mounted on
his military charger, followed him in silence to
the point where a large street joined, or rather
crossed, that which led from the quay on which
they had landed.</p>

<p>"Yonder swings the Flying Stag," said Ital,
pointing to an immense sign, which, mounted on
a huge wooden frame, crossed almost the whole
breadth of the street. "Your intelligence can, I
think, hardly abandon you, with such a guide-post
in your eye."</p>

<p>So saying, he turned his horse without further
farewell, and rode back to join his mistress and
her attendants.</p>

<p>Philipson's eyes rested on the same group for a
moment, when he was recalled to a sense of his
situation by the thoughts of his father; and,
spurring his jaded horse down the cross street, he
reached the hostelry of the Flying Stag.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i7">I was, I must confess,</p>
<p>Great Albion's queen in former golden days;</p>
<p>But now mischance hath trod my title down,</p>
<p>And with dishonour laid me on the ground;</p>
<p>Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,</p>
<p>And to my humble seat conform myself.</p>

<p class="i9"><i>Henry VI. Part III.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The hostelry of the Flying Stag, in Strasburg,
was, like every inn in the empire at the period,
conducted much with the same discourteous inattention
to the wants and accommodation of the
guests as that of John Mengs. But the youth and
good looks of Arthur Philipson, circumstances
which seldom or never fail to produce some effect
where the fair are concerned, prevailed upon a
short, plump, dimpled, blue-eyed, fair-skinned
yungfrau, the daughter of the landlord of the Flying
Stag (himself a fat old man, pinned to the
oaken chair in the <i>stube</i>), to carry herself to the
young Englishman with a degree of condescension
which, in the privileged race to which she belonged,
was little short of degradation. She not only put
her light buskins and her pretty ankles in danger
of being soiled by tripping across the yard to point
out an unoccupied stable, but, on Arthur's inquiry
after his father, condescended to recollect that
such a guest as he described had lodged in the
house last night, and had said he expected to meet
there a young person, his fellow-traveller.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>"I will send him out to you, fair sir," said the
little yungfrau with a smile, which, if things of
the kind are to be valued by their rare occurrence,
must have been reckoned inestimable.</p>

<p>She was as good as her word. In a few instants
the elder Philipson entered the stable, and folded
his son in his arms.</p>

<p>"My son&mdash;my dear son!" said the Englishman,
his usual stoicism broken down and melted
by natural feeling and parental tenderness,&mdash;"Welcome
to me at all times&mdash;welcome, in a
period of doubt and danger&mdash;and most welcome of
all, in a moment which forms the very crisis of
our fate. In a few hours I shall know what we
may expect from the Duke of Burgundy.&mdash;Hast
thou the token?"</p>

<p>Arthur's hand first sought that which was nearest
to his heart, both in the literal and allegorical
sense&mdash;the small parcel, namely, which Anne had
given him at parting. But he recollected himself
in the instant, and presented to his father the
packet which had been so strangely lost and
recovered at La Ferette.</p>

<p>"It hath run its own risk since you saw it," he
observed to his father, "and so have I mine. I
received hospitality at a castle last night, and
behold a body of lanzknechts in the neighbourhood
began in the morning to mutiny for their pay.
The inhabitants fled from the castle to escape their
violence, and, as we passed their leaguer in the
grey of the morning, a drunken Baaren-hauter shot
my poor horse, and I was forced, in the way of
exchange, to take up with his heavy Flemish
animal, with its steel saddle, and its clumsy
chaffron."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>"Our road is beset with perils," said his father.
"I too have had my share, having been in great
danger [he told not its precise nature] at an inn
where I rested last night. But I left it in the
morning, and proceeded hither in safety. I have
at length, however, obtained a safe escort to conduct
me to the Duke's camp near Dijon; and I
trust to have an audience of him this evening.
Then, if our last hope should fail, we will seek
the seaport of Marseilles, hoist sail for Candia or
for Rhodes, and spend our lives in defence of
Christendom, since we may no longer fight for
England."</p>

<p>Arthur heard these ominous words without
reply; but they did not the less sink upon his
heart, deadly as the doom of the judge which
secludes the criminal from society and all its joys,
and condemns him to an eternal prison-house.
The bells from the cathedral began to toll at this
instant, and reminded the elder Philipson of the
duty of hearing mass, which was said at all hours
in some one or other of the separate chapels which
are contained in that magnificent pile. His son
followed, on an intimation of his pleasure.</p>

<p>In approaching the access to this superb cathedral,
the travellers found it obstructed, as is usual
in Catholic countries, by the number of mendicants
of both sexes, who crowded round the entrance
to give the worshippers an opportunity of
discharging the duty of alms-giving, so positively
enjoined as a chief observance of their Church.
The Englishmen extricated themselves from their
importunity by bestowing, as is usual on such
occasions, a donative of small coin upon those who
appeared most needy, or most deserving of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
charity. One tall woman stood on the steps close
to the door, and extended her hand to the elder
Philipson, who, struck with her appearance, exchanged
for a piece of silver the copper coins
which he had been distributing amongst others.</p>

<p>"A marvel!" she said, in the English language,
but in a tone calculated only to be heard by him
alone, although his son also caught the sound and
sense of what she said,&mdash;"Ay, a miracle!&mdash;An
Englishman still possesses a silver piece, and can
afford to bestow it on the poor!"</p>

<p>Arthur was sensible that his father started
somewhat at the voice or words, which bore, even
in his ear, something of deeper import than the
observation of an ordinary mendicant. But after
a glance at the female who thus addressed him,
his father passed onwards into the body of the
church, and was soon engaged in attending to the
solemn ceremony of the mass, as it was performed
by a priest at the altar of a chapel divided from
the main body of the splendid edifice, and dedicated,
as it appeared from the image over the altar,
to St. George; that military saint, whose real
history is so obscure, though his popular legend
rendered him an object of peculiar veneration
during the feudal ages. The ceremony was begun
and finished with all customary forms. The
officiating priest, with his attendants, withdrew,
and though some of the few worshippers who had
assisted at the solemnity remained telling their
beads, and occupied with the performance of their
private devotions, far the greater part left the
chapel, to visit other shrines, or to return to the
prosecution of their secular affairs.</p>

<p>But Arthur Philipson remarked that, whilst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
they dropped off one after another, the tall woman
who had received his father's alms continued to
kneel near the altar; and he was yet more surprised
to see that his father himself, who, he had
many reasons to know, was desirous to spend in
the church no more time than the duties of devotion
absolutely claimed, remained also on his
knees, with his eyes resting on the form of the
veiled devotee (such she seemed from her dress),
as if his own motions were to be guided by hers.
By no idea which occurred to him was Arthur able
to form the least conjecture as to his father's
motives&mdash;he only knew that he was engaged in
a critical and dangerous negotiation, liable to influence
or interruption from various quarters; and
that political suspicion was so generally awake,
both in France, Italy, and Flanders, that the most
important agents were often obliged to assume the
most impenetrable disguises, in order to insinuate
themselves without suspicion into the countries
where their services were required. Louis XI.,
in particular, whose singular policy seemed in
some degree to give a character to the age in which
he lived, was well known to have disguised his
principal emissaries and envoys in the fictitious
garbs of mendicant monks, minstrels, gypsies,
and other privileged wanderers of the meanest
description.</p>

<p>Arthur concluded, therefore, that it was not
improbable that this female might, like themselves,
be something more than her dress imported;
and he resolved to observe his father's deportment
towards her, and regulate his own actions accordingly.
A bell at last announced that mass, upon
a more splendid scale, was about to be celebrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
before the high altar of the cathedral itself, and
its sound withdrew from the sequestered chapel of
St. George the few who had remained at the shrine
of the military saint, excepting the father and son,
and the female penitent who kneeled opposite to
them. When the last of the worshippers had
retired, the female arose and advanced towards
the elder Philipson, who, folding his arms on his
bosom, and stooping his head, in an attitude of
obeisance which his son had never before seen him
assume, appeared rather to wait what she had to
say, than to propose addressing her.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Four lamps, lighted before
the shrine of the saint, cast a dim radiance on his
armour and steed, represented as he was in the act
of transfixing with his lance the prostrate dragon,
whose outstretched wings and writhing neck were
in part touched by their beams. The rest of the
chapel was dimly illuminated by the autumnal
sun, which could scarce find its way through the
stained panes of the small lanceolated window,
which was its only aperture to the open air. The
light fell doubtful and gloomy, tinged with the
various hues through which it passed, upon the
stately yet somewhat broken and dejected form of
the female, and on those of the melancholy and
anxious father, and his son, who, with all the
eager interest of youth, suspected and anticipated
extraordinary consequences from so singular an
interview.</p>

<p>At length the female approached to the same
side of the shrine with Arthur and his father, as
if to be more distinctly heard, without being
obliged to raise the slow solemn voice in which
she had spoken.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you here worship," she said, "the St.
George of Burgundy, or the St. George of merry
England, the flower of chivalry?"</p>

<p>"I serve," said Philipson, folding his hands
humbly on his bosom, "the saint to whom this
chapel is dedicated, and the Deity with whom I
hope for his holy intercession, whether here or in
my native country."</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;you," said the female, "even you can
forget&mdash;you, even you, who have been numbered
among the mirror of knighthood&mdash;can forget that
you have worshipped in the royal fane of Windsor&mdash;that
you have there bent a <i>gartered</i> knee, where
kings and princes kneeled around you&mdash;you can
forget this, and make your orisons at a foreign
shrine, with a heart undisturbed with the thoughts
of what you have been,&mdash;praying, like some poor
peasant, for bread and life during the day that
passes over you."</p>

<p>"Lady," replied Philipson, "in my proudest
hours, I was, before the Being to whom I preferred
my prayers, but as a worm in the dust&mdash;In His
eyes I am now neither less nor more, degraded as
I may be in the opinion of my fellow-reptiles."</p>

<p>"How canst thou think thus?" said the devotee;
"and yet it is well with thee that thou canst.
But what have thy losses been, compared to
mine!"</p>

<p>She put her hand to her brow, and seemed for a
moment overpowered by agonising recollections.</p>

<p>Arthur pressed to his father's side, and inquired,
in a tone of interest which could not be repressed,
"Father, who is this lady?&mdash;Is it my mother?"</p>

<p>"No, my son," answered Philipson;&mdash;"peace, for
the sake of all you hold dear or holy!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>The singular female, however, heard both the
question and answer, though expressed in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "young man&mdash;I am&mdash;I should
say I was&mdash;your mother; the mother, the protectress,
of all that was noble in England&mdash;I am
Margaret of Anjou."</p>

<p>Arthur sank on his knees before the dauntless
widow of Henry the Sixth, who so long, and in
such desperate circumstances, upheld, by unyielding
courage and deep policy, the sinking cause of
her feeble husband; and who, if she occasionally
abused victory by cruelty and revenge, had made
some atonement by the indomitable resolution with
which she had supported the fiercest storms of
adversity. Arthur had been bred in devoted adherence
to the now dethroned line of Lancaster, of
which his father was one of the most distinguished
supporters; and his earliest deeds of arms, which,
though unfortunate, were neither obscure nor ignoble,
had been done in their cause. With an
enthusiasm belonging to his age and education,
he in the same instant flung his bonnet on the
pavement, and knelt at the feet of his ill-fated
sovereign.</p>

<p>Margaret threw back the veil which concealed
those noble and majestic features, which even yet,&mdash;though
rivers of tears had furrowed her cheek,&mdash;though
care, disappointment, domestic grief,
and humbled pride had quenched the fire of her
eye, and wasted the smooth dignity of her forehead,&mdash;even
yet showed the remains of that
beauty which once was held unequalled in Europe.
The apathy with which a succession of misfortunes
and disappointed hopes had chilled the feelings of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
the unfortunate Princess was for a moment melted
by the sight of the fair youth's enthusiasm. She
abandoned one hand to him, which he covered
with tears and kisses, and with the other stroked
with maternal tenderness his curled locks, as she
endeavoured to raise him from the posture he had
assumed. His father, in the meanwhile, shut the
door of the chapel, and placed his back against it,
withdrawing himself thus from the group, as if
for the purpose of preventing any stranger from
entering, during a scene so extraordinary.</p>

<p>"And thou, then," said Margaret, in a voice
where female tenderness combated strangely with
her natural pride of rank, and with the calm,
stoical indifference induced by the intensity of
her personal misfortunes; "thou, fair youth, art
the last scion of the noble stem, so many fair
boughs of which have fallen in our hapless cause.
Alas, alas! what can I do for thee? Margaret has
not even a blessing to bestow. So wayward is her
fate, that her benedictions are curses, and she has
but to look on you and wish you well, to insure
your speedy and utter ruin. I&mdash;I have been the
fatal poison-tree, whose influence has blighted and
destroyed all the fair plants that arose beside and
around me, and brought death upon every one, yet
am myself unable to find it!"</p>

<p>"Noble and royal mistress," said the elder
Englishman, "let not your princely courage,
which has borne such extremities, be dismayed,
now that they are passed over, and that a chance
at least of happier times is approaching to you and
to England."</p>

<p>"To England, to <i>me</i>, noble Oxford!" said the
forlorn and widowed Queen.&mdash;"If to-morrow's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
sun could place me once more on the throne of
England, could it give back to me what I have
lost? I speak not of wealth or power&mdash;they are
as nothing in the balance&mdash;I speak not of the
hosts of noble friends who have fallen in defence
of me and mine&mdash;Somersets, Percys, Staffords,
Cliffords&mdash;they have found their place in fame, in
the annals of their country&mdash;I speak not of my
husband, he has exchanged the state of a suffering
saint upon earth for that of a glorified saint in
heaven&mdash;But oh, Oxford! my son&mdash;my Edward!&mdash;Is
it possible for me to look on this youth, and
not remember that thy countess and I on the same
night gave birth to two fair boys? How oft we
endeavoured to prophesy their future fortunes, and
to persuade ourselves that the same constellation
which shone on their birth would influence their
succeeding life, and hold a friendly and equal bias
till they reached some destined goal of happiness
and honour! Thy Arthur lives; but, alas! my
Edward, born under the same auspices, fills a
bloody grave!"</p>

<p>She wrapped her head in her mantle, as if to
stifle the complaints and groans which maternal
affection poured forth at these cruel recollections.
Philipson, or the exiled Earl of Oxford as we may
now term him, distinguished in those changeful
times by the steadiness with which he had always
maintained his loyalty to the line of Lancaster,
saw the imprudence of indulging his sovereign in
her weakness.</p>

<p>"Royal mistress," he said, "life's journey is
that of a brief winter's day, and its course will
run on, whether we avail ourselves of its progress
or no. My sovereign is, I trust, too much mistress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
of herself to suffer lamentation for what is
passed to deprive her of the power of using the
present time. I am here in obedience to your
command; I am to see Burgundy forthwith, and
if I find him pliant to the purpose to which we
would turn him, events may follow which will
change into gladness our present mourning. But
we must use our opportunity with speed as well as
zeal. Let me know then, madam, for what reason
your Majesty hath come hither, disguised and in
danger? Surely it was not merely to weep over
this young man that the high-minded Queen Margaret
left her father's court, disguised herself in
mean attire, and came from a place of safety to
one of doubt at least, if not of danger?"</p>

<p>"You mock me, Oxford," said the unfortunate
Queen, "or you deceive yourself, if you think you
still serve that Margaret whose word was never
spoken without a reason, and whose slightest action
was influenced by a motive. Alas! I am no longer
the same firm and rational being. The feverish
character of grief, while it makes one place hateful
to me, drives me to another in very impotence and
impatience of spirit. My father's residence, thou
say'st, is safe; but is it tolerable for such a soul as
mine? Can one who has been deprived of the
noblest and richest kingdom of Europe&mdash;one who
has lost hosts of noble friends&mdash;one who is a
widowed consort, a childless mother&mdash;one upon
whose head Heaven hath poured forth its last vial
of unmitigated wrath,&mdash;can she stoop to be the
companion of a weak old man, who, in sonnets
and in music, in mummery and folly, in harping
and rhyming, finds a comfort for all that
poverty has that is distressing; and, what is still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
worse, even a solace in all that is ridiculous and
contemptible?"</p>

<p>"Nay, with your leave, madam," said her counsellor,
"blame not the good King René (<a href="#ednote_a" name="enanchor_a" id="enanchor_a" ><i>a</i></a>),<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>

because, persecuted by fortune, he has been able
to find out for himself humbler sources of solace,
which your prouder spirit is disposed to disdain.
A contention among his minstrels has for him the
animation of a knightly combat; and a crown of
flowers, twined by his troubadours and graced by
their sonnets, he accounts a valuable compensation
for the diadems of Jerusalem, of Naples, and of
both Sicilies, of which he only possesses the
empty titles."</p>

<p>"Speak not to me of the pitiable old man," said
Margaret; "sunk below even the hatred of his
worst enemies, and never thought worthy of anything
more than contempt. I tell thee, noble
Oxford, I have been driven nearly mad with my
forced residence at Aix, in the paltry circle which
he calls his court. My ears, tuned as they now
are only to sounds of affliction, are not so weary
of the eternal tinkling of harps, and squeaking of
rebecks, and snapping of castanets;&mdash;my eyes are
not so tired of the beggarly affectation of court ceremonial,
which is only respectable when it implies
wealth and expresses power,&mdash;as my very soul is
sick of the paltry ambition which can find pleasure
in spangles, tassels, and trumpery, when the
reality of all that is great and noble hath passed
away. No, Oxford. If I am doomed to lose the
last cast which fickle fortune seems to offer me, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
will retreat into the meanest convent in the Pyrenean
hills, and at least escape the insult of the
idiot gaiety of my father.&mdash;Let him pass from our
memory as from the page of history, in which his
name will never be recorded. I have much of
more importance both to hear and to tell.&mdash;And
now, my Oxford, what news from Italy? Will
the Duke of Milan afford us assistance with his
counsels, or with his treasures?"</p>

<p>"With his counsels willingly, madam; but how
you will relish them I know not, since he recommends
to us submission to our hapless fate, and
resignation to the will of Providence."</p>

<p>"The wily Italian! Will not, then, Galeasso
advance any part of his hoards, or assist a friend,
to whom he hath in his time full often sworn
faith?"</p>

<p>"Not even the diamonds which I offered to
deposit in his hands," answered the Earl, "could
make him unlock his treasury to supply us with
ducats for our enterprise. Yet he said, if Charles
of Burgundy should think seriously of an exertion
in our favour, such was his regard for that great
prince, and his deep sense of your Majesty's misfortunes,
that he would consider what the state of
his exchequer, though much exhausted, and the
condition of his subjects, though impoverished
by taxes and talliages, would permit him to
advance in your behalf."</p>

<p>"The double-faced hypocrite!" said Margaret.
"If the assistance of the princely Burgundy lends
us a chance of regaining what is our own, then he
will give us some paltry parcel of crowns, that
our restored prosperity may forget his indifference
to our adversity!&mdash;But what of Burgundy? I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
have ventured hither to tell you what I have
learned, and to hear report of your proceedings&mdash;a
trusty watch provides for the secrecy of our
interview. My impatience to see you brought me
hither in this mean disguise. I have a small
retinue at a convent a mile beyond the town&mdash;I
have had your arrival watched by the faithful
Lambert&mdash;and now I come to know your hopes or
your fears, and to tell you my own."</p>

<p>"Royal lady," said the Earl, "I have not seen
the Duke. You know his temper to be wilful,
sudden, haughty, and unpersuadable. If he can
adopt the calm and sustained policy which the
times require, I little doubt his obtaining full
amends of Louis, his sworn enemy, and even of
Edward, his ambitious brother-in-law. But if he
continues to yield to extravagant fits of passion,
with or without provocation, he may hurry into
a quarrel with the poor but hardy Helvetians,
and is likely to engage in a perilous contest,
in which he cannot be expected to gain anything,
while he undergoes a chance of the most serious
losses."</p>

<p>"Surely," replied the Queen, "he will not trust
the usurper Edward, even in the very moment
when he is giving the greatest proof of treachery
to his alliance?"</p>

<p>"In what respect, madam?" replied Oxford.
"The news you allude to has not reached me."</p>

<p>"How, my lord? Am I then the first to tell
you that Edward of York has crossed the sea (<a href="#ednote_b" name="enanchor_b" id="enanchor_b" ><i>b</i></a>)
with such an army as scarce even the renowned
Henry V., my father-in-law, ever transported from
France to Italy?"</p>

<p>"So much I have indeed heard was expected,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
said Oxford; "and I anticipated the effect as fatal
to our cause."</p>

<p>"Edward is arrived," said Margaret, "and the
traitor and usurper hath sent defiance to Louis of
France, and demanded of him the crown of that
kingdom as his own right&mdash;that crown which
was placed on the head of my unhappy husband,
when he was yet a child in the cradle."</p>

<p>"It is then decided&mdash;the English are in
France!" answered Oxford, in a tone expressive of
the deepest anxiety.&mdash;"And whom brings Edward
with him on this expedition?"</p>

<p>"All&mdash;all the bitterest enemies of our house
and cause&mdash;The false, the traitorous, the dishonoured
George, whom he calls Duke of Clarence&mdash;the
blood-drinker, Richard&mdash;the licentious
Hastings&mdash;Howard&mdash;Stanley&mdash;in a word, the
leaders of all those traitors whom I would not
name, unless by doing so my curses could sweep
them from the face of the earth."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;I tremble to ask," said the Earl&mdash;"Does
Burgundy prepare to join them as a brother of the
war, and make common cause with this Yorkish
host against King Louis of France?"</p>

<p>"By my advices," replied the Queen, "and they
are both private and sure, besides that they are
confirmed by the bruit of common fame&mdash;No, my
good Oxford, no!"</p>

<p>"For that may the Saints be praised!" answered
Oxford. "Edward of York&mdash;I will not malign
even an enemy&mdash;is a bold and fearless leader&mdash;But
he is neither Edward the Third, nor the heroic
Black Prince&mdash;nor is he that fifth Henry of Lancaster,
under whom I won my spurs, and to whose
lineage the thoughts of his glorious memory would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
have made me faithful, had my plighted vows of
allegiance ever permitted me to entertain a thought
of varying, or of defection. Let Edward engage in
war with Louis without the aid of Burgundy, on
which he has reckoned. Louis is indeed no hero,
but he is a cautious and skilful general, more to
be dreaded, perhaps, in these politic days, than if
Charlemagne could again raise the Oriflamme,
surrounded by Roland and all his paladins. Louis
will not hazard such fields as those of Cressy, of
Poictiers, or of Agincourt. With a thousand
lances from Hainault, and twenty thousand crowns
from Burgundy, Edward shall risk the loss of
England, while he is engaged in a protracted
struggle for the recovery of Normandy and Guienne.
But what are the movements of Burgundy?"</p>

<p>"He has menaced Germany," said Margaret,
"and his troops are now employed in overrunning
Lorraine, of which he has seized the principal
towns and castles."</p>

<p>"Where is Ferrand de Vaudemont&mdash;a youth, it
is said, of courage and enterprise, and claiming
Lorraine in right of his mother, Yolande of Anjou,
the sister of your Grace?"</p>

<p>"Fled," replied the Queen, "into Germany or
Helvetia."</p>

<p>"Let Burgundy beware of him," said the experienced
Earl; "for should the disinherited youth
obtain confederates in Germany, and allies among
the hardy Swiss, Charles of Burgundy may find
him a far more formidable enemy than he expects.
We are strong for the present, only in the Duke's
strength, and if it is wasted in idle and desultory
efforts, our hopes, alas! vanish with his power,
even if he should be found to have the decided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
will to assist us. My friends in England are
resolute not to stir without men and money from
Burgundy."</p>

<p>"It is a fear," said Margaret, "but not our
worst fear. I dread more the policy of Louis,
who, unless my espials have grossly deceived me,
has even already proposed a secret peace to Edward,
offering with large sums of money to purchase
England to the Yorkists, and a truce of seven
years."</p>

<p>"It cannot be," said Oxford. "No Englishman,
commanding such an army as Edward must now
lead, dares for very shame to retire from France
without a manly attempt to recover his lost
provinces."</p>

<p>"Such would have been the thoughts of a rightful
prince," said Margaret, "who left behind him
an obedient and faithful kingdom. Such may not
be the thoughts of this Edward, misnamed Plantagenet,
base perhaps in mind as in blood, since
they say his real father was one Blackburn, an
archer of Middleham&mdash;usurper, at least, if not
bastard&mdash;such will not be his thoughts.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
 Every
breeze that blows from England will bring with
it apprehensions of defection amongst those over
whom he has usurped authority. He will not
sleep in peace till he returns to England with
those cut-throats, whom he relies upon for the
defence of his stolen crown. He will engage in
no war with Louis, for Louis will not hesitate to
soothe his pride by humiliation&mdash;to gorge his
avarice and pamper his voluptuous prodigality by
sums of gold&mdash;and I fear much we shall soon hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
of the English army retiring from France with the
idle boast, that they have displayed their banners
once more, for a week or two, in the provinces
which were formerly their own."</p>

<p>"It the more becomes us to be speedy in moving
Burgundy to decision," replied Oxford; "and for
that purpose I post to Dijon. Such an army as
Edward's cannot be transported over the narrow
seas in several weeks. The probability is, that
they must winter in France, even if they should
have truce with King Louis. With a thousand
Hainault lances from the eastern part of Flanders,
I can be soon in the North, where we have many
friends, besides the assurance of help from Scotland.
The faithful West will rise at a signal&mdash;a
Clifford can be found, though the mountain
mists have hid him from Richard's researches&mdash;the
Welsh will assemble at the rallying word of
Tudor&mdash;the Red Rose raises its head once more&mdash;and
so, God save King Henry!"</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the Queen&mdash;"But no husband&mdash;no
friend of mine&mdash;the son but of my mother-in-law
by a Welsh chieftain&mdash;cold, they say, and
crafty&mdash;But be it so&mdash;let me only see Lancaster
triumph, and obtain revenge upon York, and I
will die contented!"</p>

<p>"It is then your pleasure that I should make
the proffers expressed by your Grace's former mandates,
to induce Burgundy to stir himself in our
cause? If he learns the proposal of a truce betwixt
France and England, it will sting sharper than
aught I can say."</p>

<p>"Promise all, however," said the Queen. "I
know his inmost soul&mdash;it is set upon extending
the dominions of his House in every direction.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
For this he has seized Gueldres&mdash;for this he now
overruns and occupies Lorraine&mdash;for this he covets
such poor remnants of Provence as my father still
calls his own. With such augmented territories,
he proposes to exchange his ducal diadem for an
arched crown of independent sovereignty. Tell
the Duke, Margaret can assist his views&mdash;tell
him, that my father René shall disown the opposition
made to the Duke's seizure of Lorraine&mdash;He
shall do more&mdash;he shall declare Charles his
heir in Provence, with my ample consent&mdash;tell
him, the old man shall cede his dominions to him
upon the instant that his Hainaulters embark for
England, some small pension deducted to maintain
a concert of fiddlers, and a troop of morrice-dancers.
These are René's only earthly wants.
Mine are still fewer&mdash;Revenge upon York, and a
speedy grave!&mdash;For the paltry gold which we may
need, thou hast jewels to pledge&mdash;For the other
conditions, security if required."</p>

<p>"For these, madam, I can pledge my knightly
word, in addition to your royal faith; and if more
is required, my son shall be a hostage with
Burgundy."</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;no!" exclaimed the dethroned Queen,
touched by perhaps the only tender feeling, which
repeated and extraordinary misfortunes had not
chilled into insensibility,&mdash;"Hazard not the life
of the noble youth&mdash;he that is the last of the
loyal and faithful House of Vere&mdash;he that should
have been the brother in arms of my beloved
Edward&mdash;he that had so nearly been his companion
in a bloody and untimely grave! Do not
involve this poor child in these fatal intrigues,
which have been so baneful to his family. Let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
him go with me. Him at least I will shelter
from danger whilst I live, and provide for when
I am no more."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, madam," said Oxford, with the
firmness which distinguished him. "My son, as
you deign to recollect, is a De Vere, destined,
perhaps, to be the last of his name. Fall, he
may, but it must not be without honour. To
whatever dangers his duty and allegiance call
him, be it from sword or lance, axe or gibbet, to
these he must expose himself frankly, when his
doing so can mark his allegiance. His ancestors
have shown him how to brave them all."</p>

<p>"True, true," exclaimed the unfortunate Queen,
raising her arms wildly,&mdash;"All must perish&mdash;all
that have honoured Lancaster&mdash;all that have
loved Margaret, or whom she has loved! The
destruction must be universal&mdash;the young must
fall with the old&mdash;not a lamb of the scattered
flock shall escape!"</p>

<p>"For God's sake, gracious madam," said Oxford,
"compose yourself!&mdash;I hear them knock on the
chapel door."</p>

<p>"It is the signal of parting," said the exiled
Queen, collecting herself. "Do not fear, noble
Oxford, I am not often thus; but how seldom do
I see those friends, whose faces and voices can disturb
the composure of my despair! Let me tie
this relic about thy neck, good youth, and fear not
its evil influence, though you receive it from an
ill-omened hand. It was my husband's, blessed
by many a prayer, and sanctified by many a holy
tear; even my unhappy hands cannot pollute it.
I should have bound it on my Edward's bosom on
the dreadful morning of Tewkesbury fight; but he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
armed early&mdash;went to the field without seeing
me, and all my purpose was vain."</p>

<p>She passed a golden chain round Arthur's neck
as she spoke, which contained a small gold crucifix
of rich but barbarous manufacture. It had
belonged, said tradition, to Edward the Confessor.
The knock at the door of the chapel was repeated.</p>

<p>"We must not tarry," said Margaret; "let us
part here&mdash;you for Dijon, I to Aix, my abode
of unrest in Provence. Farewell&mdash;we may meet
in a better hour&mdash;yet how can I hope it? Thus
I said on the morning before the fight of St. Albans&mdash;thus
on the dark dawning of Towton&mdash;thus
on the yet more bloody field of Tewkesbury&mdash;and
what was the event? Yet hope is a plant
which cannot be rooted out of a noble breast,
till the last heart-string crack as it is pulled
away."</p>

<p>So saying, she passed through the chapel door,
and mingled in the miscellaneous assemblage of
personages who worshipped or indulged their curiosity,
or consumed their idle hours amongst the
aisles of the cathedral.</p>

<p>Philipson and his son, both deeply impressed
with the singular interview which had just taken
place, returned to their inn, where they found a
pursuivant, with the Duke of Burgundy's badge
and livery, who informed them, that if they were
the English merchants who were carrying wares
of value to the court of the Duke, he had orders
to afford them the countenance of his escort and
inviolable character. Under his protection they
set out from Strasburg; but such was the uncertainty
of the Duke of Burgundy's motions, and
such the numerous obstacles which occurred to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
interrupt their journey, in a country disturbed by
the constant passage of troops and preparation for
war, that it was evening on the second day ere
they reached the plain near Dijon, on which the
whole, or great part of his power, lay encamped.

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Thus said the Duke&mdash;thus did the Duke infer.</p>

<p class="i12"><i>Richard III.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The eyes of the elder traveller were well accustomed
to sights of martial splendour, yet even he
was dazzled with the rich and glorious display of
the Burgundian camp, in which, near the walls of
Dijon, Charles, the wealthiest prince in Europe,
had displayed his own extravagance, and encouraged
his followers to similar profusion. The
pavilions of the meanest officers were of silk and
samite, while those of the nobility and great
leaders glittered with cloth of silver, cloth of
gold, variegated tapestry, and other precious materials,
which in no other situation would have been
employed as a cover from the weather, but would
themselves have been thought worthy of the most
careful protection. The horsemen and infantry
who mounted guard were arrayed in the richest
and most gorgeous armour. A beautiful and very
numerous train of artillery was drawn up near
the entrance of the camp, and in its commander
Philipson (to give the Earl the travelling name
to which our readers are accustomed) recognised
Henry Colvin(<a href="#ednote_c" name="enanchor_c" id="enanchor_c" ><i>c</i></a>), an Englishman of inferior birth,
but distinguished for his skill in conducting these
terrible engines, which had of late come into
general use in war. The banners and pennons
which were displayed by every knight, baron, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
man of rank floated before their tents, and the
owners of these transitory dwellings sat at the
door half-armed, and enjoyed the military contests
of the soldiers, in wrestling, pitching the bar, and
other athletic exercises.</p>

<p>Long rows of the noblest horses were seen at
picket, prancing and tossing their heads, as impatient
of the inactivity to which they were confined,
or were heard neighing over the provender
which was spread plentifully before them. The
soldiers formed joyous groups around the minstrels
and strolling jugglers, or were engaged in drinking-parties
at the sutlers' tents; others strolled about
with folded arms, casting their eyes now and then
to the sinking sun, as if desirous that the hour
should arrive which should put an end to a day
unoccupied, and therefore tedious.</p>

<p>At length the travellers reached, amidst the
dazzling varieties of this military display, the
pavilion of the Duke himself, before which floated
heavily in the evening breeze the broad and rich
banner, in which glowed the armorial bearings
and quarterings of a prince, Duke of six provinces,
and Count of fifteen counties, who was, from his
power, his disposition, and the success which
seemed to attend his enterprises, the general dread
of Europe. The pursuivant made himself known
to some of the household, and the Englishmen
were immediately received with courtesy, though
not such as to draw attention upon them, and conveyed
to a neighbouring tent, the residence of a
general officer, which they were given to understand
was destined for their accommodation, and
where their packages accordingly were deposited,
and refreshments offered them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p>"As the camp is filled," said the domestic who
waited upon them, "with soldiers of different
nations and uncertain dispositions, the Duke of
Burgundy, for the safety of your merchandise, has
ordered you the protection of a regular sentinel.
In the meantime, be in readiness to wait on his
Highness, seeing you may look to be presently
sent for."</p>

<p>Accordingly, the elder Philipson was shortly
after summoned to the Duke's presence, introduced
by a back entrance into the ducal pavilion, and
into that part of it which, screened by close curtains
and wooden barricades, formed Charles's own
separate apartment. The plainness of the furniture,
and the coarse apparatus of the Duke's
toilette, formed a strong contrast to the appearance
of the exterior of the pavilion; for Charles, whose
character was, in that as in other things, far from
consistent, exhibited in his own person during
war an austerity, or rather coarseness of dress, and
sometimes of manners also, which was more like
the rudeness of a German lanzknecht, than the
bearing of a prince of exalted rank; while, at the
same time, he encouraged and enjoined a great
splendour of expense and display amongst his vassals
and courtiers, as if to be rudely attired, and
to despise every restraint, even of ordinary ceremony,
were a privilege of the sovereign alone.
Yet when it pleased him to assume state in person
and manners, none knew better than Charles of
Burgundy how he ought to adorn and demean
himself.</p>

<p>Upon his toilette appeared brushes and combs,
which might have claimed dismissal as past the
term of service, over-worn hats and doublets, dog-leashes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
leather-belts, and other such paltry articles;
amongst which lay at random, as it seemed, the
great diamond called Sanci,&mdash;the three rubies
termed the Three Brothers of Antwerp,&mdash;another
great diamond called the Lamp of Flanders, and
other precious stones of scarcely inferior value and
rarity. This extraordinary display somewhat resembled
the character of the Duke himself, who
mixed cruelty with justice, magnanimity with
meanness of spirit, economy with extravagance,
and liberality with avarice; being, in fact, consistent
in nothing excepting in his obstinate
determination to follow the opinion he had once
formed, in every situation of things, and through
all variety of risks.</p>

<p>In the midst of the valueless and inestimable
articles of his wardrobe and toilette, the Duke of
Burgundy called out to the English traveller,
"Welcome, Herr Philipson&mdash;welcome, you of a
nation whose traders are princes, and their merchants
the mighty ones of the earth. What new
commodities have you brought to gull us with?
You merchants, by St. George, are a wily
generation."</p>

<p>"Faith, no new merchandise I, my lord,"
answered the elder Englishman; "I bring but the
commodities which I showed your Highness the
last time I communicated with you, in the hope
of a poor trader, that your Grace may find them
more acceptable upon a review, than when you
first saw them."</p>

<p>"It is well, Sir&mdash;Philipville, I think they call
you?&mdash;you are a simple trader, or you take me for
a silly purchaser, that you think to gull me with
the same wares which I fancied not formerly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Change of fashion, man&mdash;novelty&mdash;is the motto
of commerce; your Lancaster wares have had their
day, and I have bought of them like others, and
was like enough to have paid dear for them too.
York is all the vogue now."</p>

<p>"It may be so among the vulgar," said the Earl
of Oxford; "but for souls like your Highness,
faith, honour, and loyalty are jewels which change
of fancy, or mutability of taste, cannot put out of
fashion."</p>

<p>"Why, it may be, noble Oxford," said the
Duke, "that I preserve in my secret mind some
veneration for these old-fashioned qualities, else
why should I have such regard for your person, in
which they have ever been distinguished? But
my situation is painfully urgent, and should I
make a false step at this crisis, I might break the
purposes of my whole life. Observe me, Sir Merchant.
Here has come over your old competitor,
Blackburn, whom some call Edward of York and
of London, with a commodity of bows and bills
such as never entered France since King Arthur's
time; and he offers to enter into joint adventure
with me, or, in plain speech, to make common
cause with Burgundy, till we smoke out of his
earths the old fox Louis, and nail his hide to the
stable-door. In a word, England invites me to
take part with him against my most wily and
inveterate enemy, the King of France; to rid
myself of the chain of vassalage, and to ascend
into the rank of independent princes;&mdash;how
think you, noble Earl, can I forego this seducing
temptation?"</p>

<p>"You must ask this of some of your counsellors
of Burgundy," said Oxford; "it is a question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
fraught too deeply with ruin to my cause, for me
to give a fair opinion on it."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said Charles, "I ask thee, as
an honourable man, what objections you see to
the course proposed to me? Speak your mind,
and speak it freely."</p>

<p>"My lord, I know it is in your Highness's
nature to entertain no doubts of the facility of
executing anything which you have once determined
shall be done. Yet, though this prince-like
disposition may in some cases prepare for its own
success, and has often done so, there are others, in
which, persisting in our purpose, merely because
we have once willed it, leads not to success, but
to ruin. Look, therefore, at this English army;&mdash;winter
is approaching, where are they to be lodged?
how are they to be victualled? by whom are they
to be paid? Is your Highness to take all the
expense and labour of fitting them for the summer
campaign? for, rely on it, an English army never
was, nor will be, fit for service, till they have
been out of their own island long enough to accustom
them to military duty. They are men, I
grant, the fittest for soldiers in the world; but
they are not soldiers as yet, and must be trained
to become such at your Highness's expense."</p>

<p>"Be it so," said Charles; "I think the Low
Countries can find food for the beef-consuming
knaves for a few weeks, and villages for them to
lie in, and officers to train their sturdy limbs to
war, and provost-marshals enough to reduce their
refractory spirit to discipline."</p>

<p>"What happens next?" said Oxford. "You
march to Paris, add to Edward's usurped power
another kingdom; restore to him all the possessions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
which England ever had in France, Normandy,
Maine, Anjou, Gascony, and all besides&mdash;Can you
trust this Edward when you shall have thus fostered
his strength, and made him far stronger than
this Louis whom you have united to pull down?"</p>

<p>"By St. George, I will not dissemble with you!
It is in that very point that my doubts trouble me.
Edward is indeed my brother-in-law, but I am a
man little inclined to put my head under my
wife's girdle."</p>

<p>"And the times," said Philipson, "have too
often shown the inefficiency of family alliances, to
prevent the most gross breaches of faith."</p>

<p>"You say well, Earl. Clarence betrayed his
father-in-law; Louis poisoned his brother&mdash;Domestic
affections, pshaw! they sit warm enough
by a private man's fireside, but they cannot come
into fields of battle, or princes' halls, where the
wind blows cold. No, my alliance with Edward
by marriage were little succour to me in time of
need. I would as soon ride an unbroken horse,
with no better bridle than a lady's garter. But
what then is the result? He wars on Louis;
whichever gains the better, I, who must be
strengthened in their mutual weakness, receive
the advantage&mdash;The Englishmen slay the French
with their cloth-yard shafts, and the Frenchmen,
by skirmishes, waste, weaken, and destroy the
English. With spring I take the field with an
army superior to both, and then, St. George for
Burgundy!"</p>

<p>"And if, in the meanwhile, your Highness will
deign to assist, even in the most trifling degree, a
cause the most honourable that ever knight laid
lance in rest for,&mdash;a moderate sum of money, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
a small body of Hainault lances, who may gain
both fame and fortune by the service, may replace
the injured heir of Lancaster in the possession of
his native and rightful dominion."</p>

<p>"Ay, marry, Sir Earl," said the Duke, "you
come roundly to the point; but we have seen, and
indeed partly assisted, at so many turns betwixt
York and Lancaster, that we have some doubt
which is the side to which Heaven has given
the right, and the inclinations of the people the
effectual power; we are surprised into absolute
giddiness by so many extraordinary revolutions
of fortune as England has exhibited."</p>

<p>"A proof, my lord, that these mutations are not
yet ended, and that your generous aid may give to
the better side an effectual turn of advantage."</p>

<p>"And lend my cousin, Margaret of Anjou, my
arm to dethrone my wife's brother? Perhaps he
deserves small good-will at my hands, since he
and his insolent nobles have been urging me with
remonstrances, and even threats, to lay aside all
my own important affairs, and join Edward, forsooth,
in his knight-errant expedition against
Louis. I will march against Louis at my own
time, and not sooner; and, by St. George! neither
island king, nor island noble, shall dictate to
Charles of Burgundy. You are fine conceited companions,
you English of both sides, that think the
matters of your own bedlam island are as interesting
to all the world as to yourselves. But neither
York nor Lancaster, neither brother Blackburn nor
cousin Margaret of Anjou, not with John de Vere
to back her, shall gull me. Men lure no hawks
with empty hands."</p>

<p>Oxford, familiar with the Duke's disposition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
suffered him to exhaust himself in chafing, that
any one should pretend to dictate his course of
conduct, and, when he was at length silent,
replied with calmness&mdash;"Do I live to hear the
noble Duke of Burgundy, the mirror of European
chivalry, say, that no reason has been shown to
him for an adventure where a helpless queen is
to be redressed&mdash;a royal house raised from the
dust? Is there not immortal <i>los</i> and honour&mdash;the
trumpet of fame to proclaim the sovereign, who,
alone in a degenerate age, has united the duties
of a generous knight with those of a princely
sovereign"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The Duke interrupted him, striking him at the
same time on the shoulder&mdash;"And King René's
five hundred fiddlers to tune their cracked violins
in my praise? and King René himself to listen to
them, and say, 'Well fought, Duke&mdash;well played,
fiddler!' I tell thee, John of Oxford, when thou
and I wore maiden armour, such words as fame,
honour, <i>los</i>, knightly glory, lady's love, and so
forth, were good mottoes for our snow-white
shields, and a fair enough argument for splintering
lances&mdash;Ay, and in tilt-yard, though somewhat
old for these fierce follies, I would jeopard my
person in such a quarrel yet, as becomes a knight
of the order. But when we come to paying down
of crowns, and embarking of large squadrons, we
must have to propose to our subjects some substantial
excuse for plunging them in war; some proposal
for the public good&mdash;or, by St. George! for
our own private advantage, which is the same
thing. This is the course the world runs, and,
Oxford, to tell the plain truth, I mean to hold the
same bias."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>"Heaven forbid that I should expect your Highness
to act otherwise than with a view to your
subjects' welfare&mdash;the increase, that is, as your
Grace happily expresses it, of your own power and
dominion. The money we require is not in benevolence,
but in loan; and Margaret is willing to
deposit these jewels, of which I think your Grace
knows the value, till she shall repay the sum
which your friendship may advance in her
necessity."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" said the Duke, "would our cousin
make a pawnbroker of us, and have us deal with
her like a Jewish usurer with his debtor?&mdash;Yet,
in faith, Oxford, we may need the diamonds, for
if this business were otherwise feasible, it is possible
that I myself must become a borrower to aid
my cousin's necessities. I have applied to the
States of the Duchy, who are now sitting, and
expect, as is reasonable, a large supply. But
there are restless heads and close hands among
them, and they may be niggardly&mdash;So place the
jewels on the table in the meanwhile.&mdash;Well, say
I am to be no sufferer in purse by this feat of
knight-errantry which you propose to me, still
princes enter not into war without some view of
advantage?"</p>

<p>"Listen to me, noble sovereign. You are naturally
bent to unite the great estates of your father,
and those you have acquired by your own arms,
into a compact and firm dukedom"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Call it kingdom," said Charles; "it is the
worthier word."</p>

<p>"Into a kingdom, of which the crown shall sit
as fair and even on your Grace's brow as that of
France on your present suzerain, Louis."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>"It need not such shrewdness as yours to descry
that such is my purpose," said the Duke; "else,
wherefore am I here with helm on my head, and
sword by my side? And wherefore are my troops
seizing on the strong places in Lorraine, and
chasing before them the beggarly De Vaudemont,
who has the insolence to claim it as his inheritance?
Yes, my friend, the aggrandisement of
Burgundy is a theme for which the duke of that
fair province is bound to fight, while he can put
foot in stirrup."</p>

<p>"But think you not," said the English Earl,
"since you allow me to speak freely with your
Grace, on the footing of old acquaintanceship,
think you not that in this chart of your dominions,
otherwise so fairly bounded, there is something
on the southern frontier which might be arranged
more advantageously for a King of Burgundy?"</p>

<p>"I cannot guess whither you would lead me,"
said the Duke, looking at a map of the Duchy and
his other possessions, to which the Englishman
had pointed his attention, and then turning his
broad keen eye upon the face of the banished
Earl.</p>

<p>"I would say," replied the latter, "that, to so
powerful a prince as your Grace, there is no safe
neighbour but the sea. Here is Provence, which
interferes betwixt you and the Mediterranean;
Provence, with its princely harbours, and fertile
cornfields and vineyards. Were it not well to
include it in your map of sovereignty, and thus
touch the middle sea with one hand, while the
other rested on the sea-coast of Flanders?"</p>

<p>"Provence, said you?" replied the Duke, eagerly.
"Why, man, my very dreams are of Provence. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
cannot smell an orange but it reminds me of its
perfumed woods and bowers, its olives, citrons,
and pomegranates. But how to frame pretensions
to it? Shame it were to disturb René, the harmless
old man, nor would it become a near relation.
Then he is the uncle of Louis; and most probably,
failing his daughter Margaret, or perhaps in preference
to her, he hath named the French King
his heir."</p>

<p>"A better claim might be raised up in your
Grace's own person," said the Earl of Oxford, "if
you will afford Margaret of Anjou the succour she
requires by me."</p>

<p>"Take the aid thou requirest," replied the Duke;
"take double the amount of it in men and money!
Let me but have a claim upon Provence, though
thin as a single thread of thy Queen Margaret's
hair, and let me alone for twisting it into the
tough texture of a quadruple cable.&mdash;But I am a
fool to listen to the dreams of one who, ruined
himself, can lose little by holding forth to others
the most extravagant hopes."</p>

<p>Charles breathed high, and changed complexion
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I am not such a person, my Lord Duke," said
the Earl. "Listen to me&mdash;René is broken with
years, fond of repose, and too poor to maintain his
rank with the necessary dignity; too good-natured,
or too feeble-minded, to lay further imposts on his
subjects; weary of contending with bad fortune,
and desirous to resign his territories"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"His territories!" said Charles.</p>

<p>"Yes, all he actually possesses; and the much
more extensive dominions which he has claim to,
but which have passed from his sway."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>"You take away my breath!" said the Duke.
"René resign Provence! and what says Margaret&mdash;the
proud, the high-minded Margaret&mdash;will she
subscribe to so humiliating a proceeding?"</p>

<p>"For the chance of seeing Lancaster triumph in
England, she would resign, not only dominion,
but life itself. And, in truth, the sacrifice is less
than it may seem to be. It is certain that, when
René dies, the King of France will claim the old
man's county of Provence as a male fief, and there
is no one strong enough to back Margaret's claim
of inheritance, however just it may be."</p>

<p>"It is just," said Charles; "it is undeniable! I
will not hear of its being denied or challenged&mdash;that
is, when once it is established in our own
person. It is the true principle of the war for the
public good, that none of the great fiefs be suffered
to revert again to the crown of France, least of all
while it stands on a brow so astucious and unprincipled
as that of Louis. Burgundy joined to
Provence&mdash;a dominion from the German Ocean to
the Mediterranean! Oxford&mdash;thou art my better
angel!"</p>

<p>"Your Grace must, however, reflect," said
Oxford, "that honourable provision must be made
for King René."</p>

<p>"Certainly, man, certainly; he shall have a
score of fiddlers and jugglers to play, roar, and
recite to him from morning till night. He shall
have a court of troubadours, who shall do nothing
but drink, flute, and fiddle to him, and pronounce
<i>arrests</i> of <i>love</i>, to be confirmed or reversed by an
appeal to himself, the supreme <i>Roi d'Amour</i>. And
Margaret shall also be honourably sustained, in
the manner you may point out."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>"That will be easily settled," answered the
English Earl. "If our attempts on England succeed,
she will need no aid from Burgundy. If she
fails, she retires into a cloister, and it will not be
long that she will need the honourable maintenance
which, I am sure, your Grace's generosity
will willingly assign her."</p>

<p>"Unquestionably," answered Charles; "and on
a scale which will become us both;&mdash;but, by my
halidome, John of Vere, the abbess into whose
cloister Margaret of Anjou shall retire will have
an ungovernable penitent under her charge. Well
do I know her; and, Sir Earl, I will not clog our
discourse by expressing any doubts, that, if she
pleases, she can compel her father to resign his
estates to whomsoever she will. She is like my
brache, Gorgon, who compels whatsoever hound is
coupled with her to go the way she chooses, or she
strangles him if he resists. So has Margaret acted
with her simple-minded husband, and I am aware
that her father, a fool of a different cast, must of
necessity be equally tractable. I think <i>I</i> could
have matched her,&mdash;though my very neck aches at
the thought of the struggles we should have had for
mastery.&mdash;But you look grave, because I jest with
the pertinacious temper of my unhappy cousin."</p>

<p>"My lord," said Oxford, "whatever are or have
been the defects of my mistress, she is in distress,
and almost in desolation. She is my sovereign,
and your Highness's cousin not the less."</p>

<p>"Enough said, Sir Earl," answered the Duke.
"Let us speak seriously. Whatever we may think
of the abdication of King René, I fear we shall
find it difficult to make Louis XI. see the matter
as favourably as we do. He will hold that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
county of Provence is a male fief, and that neither
the resignation of René nor the consent of his
daughter can prevent its reverting to the crown of
France, as the King of Sicily, as they call him,
hath no male issue."</p>

<p>"That, may it please your Grace, is a question
for battle to decide; and your Highness has successfully
braved Louis for a less important stake.
All I can say is, that, if your Grace's active assistance
enables the young Earl of Richmond to
succeed in his enterprise, you shall have the aid
of three thousand English archers, if old John of
Oxford, for want of a better leader, were to bring
them over himself."</p>

<p>"A noble aid," said the Duke; "graced still
more by him who promises to lead them. Thy
succour, noble Oxford, were precious to me, did
you but come with your sword by your side, and
a single page at your back. I know you well,
both heart and head. But let us to this gear;
exiles, even the wisest, are privileged in promises,
and sometimes&mdash;excuse me, noble Oxford&mdash;impose
on themselves as well as on their friends.
What are the hopes on which you desire me again
to embark on so troubled and uncertain an ocean
as these civil contests of yours?"</p>

<p>The Earl of Oxford produced a schedule, and
explained to the Duke the plan of his expedition,
to be backed by an insurrection of the friends of
Lancaster, of which it is enough to say, that it
was bold to the verge of temerity; but yet so well
compacted and put together, as to bear, in those
times of rapid revolution, and under a leader of
Oxford's approved military skill and political sagacity,
a strong appearance of probable success.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p>While Duke Charles mused over the particulars
of an enterprise attractive and congenial to his
own disposition,&mdash;while he counted over the
affronts which he had received from his brother-in-law,
Edward IV., the present opportunity for
taking a signal revenge, and the rich acquisition
which he hoped to make in Provence by the
cession in his favour of René of Anjou and his
daughter, the Englishman failed not to press on
his consideration the urgent necessity of suffering
no time to escape.</p>

<p>"The accomplishment of this scheme," he said,
"demands the utmost promptitude. To have a
chance of success, I must be in England, with
your Grace's auxiliary forces, before Edward of
York can return from France with his army."</p>

<p>"And having come hither," said the Duke, "our
worthy brother will be in no hurry to return again.
He will meet with black-eyed French women and
ruby-coloured French wine, and brother Blackburn
is no man to leave such commodities in a hurry."</p>

<p>"My Lord Duke, I will speak truth of my
enemy. Edward is indolent and luxurious when
things are easy around him, but let him feel the
spur of necessity, and he becomes as eager as a
pampered steed. Louis, too, who seldom fails in
finding means to accomplish his ends, is bent upon
determining the English King to recross the sea&mdash;therefore,
speed, noble Prince&mdash;speed is the
soul of your enterprise."</p>

<p>"Speed!" said the Duke of Burgundy,&mdash;"Why,
I will go with you, and see the embarkation
myself; and tried, approved soldiers you shall
have, such as are nowhere to be found save in
Artois and Hainault."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p>"But pardon yet, noble Duke, the impatience of
a drowning wretch urgently pressing for assistance.&mdash;When
shall we to the coast of Flanders,
to order this important measure?"</p>

<p>"Why, in a fortnight, or perchance a week, or,
in a word, so soon as I shall have chastised to
purpose a certain gang of thieves and robbers, who,
as the scum of the caldron will always be uppermost,
have got up into the fastnesses of the Alps,
and from thence annoy our frontiers by contraband
traffic, pillage, and robbery."</p>

<p>"Your Highness means the Swiss confederates?"</p>

<p>"Ay, the peasant churls give themselves such
a name. They are a sort of manumitted slaves
of Austria, and, like a ban-dog, whose chain is
broken, they avail themselves of their liberty to
annoy and rend whatever comes in their way."</p>

<p>"I travelled through their country from Italy,"
said the exiled Earl, "and I heard it was the purpose
of the Cantons to send envoys to solicit peace
of your Highness."</p>

<p>"Peace!" exclaimed Charles.&mdash;"A proper sort
of peaceful proceedings those of their embassy have
been! Availing themselves of a mutiny of the
burghers of La Ferette, the first garrison town
which they entered, they stormed the walls, seized
on Archibald de Hagenbach, who commanded the
place on my part, and put him to death in the
market-place. Such an insult must be punished,
Sir John de Vere; and if you do not see me in the
storm of passion which it well deserves, it is
because I have already given orders to hang up the
base runagates who call themselves ambassadors."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, noble Duke," said the Englishman,
throwing himself at Charles's feet&mdash;"for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
your own character, for the sake of the peace of
Christendom, revoke such an order if it is really
given!"</p>

<p>"What means this passion?" said Duke Charles.&mdash;"What
are these men's lives to thee, excepting
that the consequences of a war may delay your
expedition for a few days?"</p>

<p>"May render it altogether abortive," said the
Earl; "nay, <i>must</i> needs do so.&mdash;Hear me, Lord
Duke. I was with these men on a part of their
journey."</p>

<p>"You!" said the Duke&mdash;"you a companion of
the paltry Swiss peasants? Misfortune has sunk
the pride of English nobility to a low ebb, when
you selected such associates."</p>

<p>"I was thrown amongst them by accident," said
the Earl. "Some of them are of noble blood, and
are, besides, men for whose peaceable intentions I
ventured to constitute myself their warrant."</p>

<p>"On my honour, my Lord of Oxford, you graced
them highly, and me no less, in interfering between
the Swiss and myself! Allow me to say
that I condescend, when, in deference to past
friendship, I permit you to speak to me of your
own English affairs. Methinks you might well
spare me your opinion upon topics with which you
have no natural concern."</p>

<p>"My Lord of Burgundy," replied Oxford, "I
followed your banner to Paris, and had the good
luck to rescue you in the fight at Mont L'Hery,
when you were beset by the French men-at-arms"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have not forgot it," said Duke Charles;
"and it is a sign that we keep the action in
remembrance, that you have been suffered to stand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
before us so long, pleading the cause of a set of
rascals, whom we are required to spare from the
gallows that groans for them, because forsooth
they have been the fellow-travellers of the Earl
of Oxford!"</p>

<p>"Not so, my lord. I ask their lives, only
because they are upon a peaceful errand, and the
leaders amongst them, at least, have no accession
to the crime of which you complain."</p>

<p>The Duke traversed the apartment with unequal
steps in much agitation, his large eyebrows drawn
down over his eyes, his hands clenched, and his
teeth set, until at length he seemed to take a resolution.
He rung a handbell of silver, which stood
upon his table.</p>

<p>"Here, Contay," he said to the gentleman of his
chamber who entered, "are these mountain fellows
yet executed?"</p>

<p>"No, may it please your Highness; but the
executioner waits them so soon as the priest hath
confessed them."</p>

<p>"Let them live," said the Duke. "We will
hear to-morrow in what manner they propose to
justify their proceedings towards us."</p>

<p>Contay bowed and left the apartment; then
turning to the Englishman, the Duke said, with
an indescribable mixture of haughtiness with
familiarity and even kindness, but having his
brows cleared, and his looks composed,&mdash;"We are
now clear of obligation, my Lord of Oxford&mdash;you
have obtained life for life&mdash;nay, to make up some
inequality which there may be betwixt the value
of the commodities bestowed, you have obtained
six lives for one. I will, therefore, pay no more
attention to you, should you again upbraid me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
with the stumbling horse at Mont L'Hery, or your
own achievements on that occasion. Most princes
are contented with privately hating such men as
have rendered them extraordinary services&mdash;I feel
no such disposition&mdash;I only detest being reminded
of having had occasion for them.&mdash;Pshaw! I am
half choked with the effort of foregoing my own
fixed resolution.&mdash;So ho! who waits there? Bring
me to drink."</p>

<p>An usher entered, bearing a large silver flagon,
which, instead of wine, was filled with ptisan
slightly flavoured by aromatic herbs.</p>

<p>"I am so hot and choleric by nature," said the
Duke, "that our leeches prohibit me from drinking
wine. But you, Oxford, are bound by no such
regimen. Get thee to thy countryman, Colvin,
the general of our artillery. We commend thee to
his custody and hospitality till to-morrow, which
must be a busy day, since I expect to receive the
answer of these wiseacres of the Dijon assembly
of estates; and have also to hear (thanks to your
lordship's interference) these miserable Swiss
envoys, as they call themselves. Well, no more
on't.&mdash;Good-night. You may communicate freely
with Colvin, who is, like yourself, an old Lancastrian.&mdash;But
hark ye, not a word respecting
Provence&mdash;not even in your sleep.&mdash;Contay, conduct
this English gentleman to Colvin's tent. He
knows my pleasure respecting him."</p>

<p>"So please your Grace," answered Contay, "I
left the English gentleman's son with Monsieur
de Colvin."</p>

<p>"What! thine own son, Oxford? And with
thee here? Why did you not tell me of him? Is
he a true scion of the ancient tree?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>"It is my pride to believe so, my lord. He has
been the faithful companion of all my dangers and
wanderings."</p>

<p>"Happy man!" said the Duke, with a sigh.
"You, Oxford, have a son to share your poverty
and distress&mdash;I have none to be partner and successor
to my greatness."</p>

<p>"You have a daughter, my lord," said the noble
De Vere, "and it is to be hoped she will one day
wed some powerful prince, who may be the stay
of your Highness's house."</p>

<p>"Never! By St. George, never!" answered the
Duke, sharply and shortly. "I will have no son-in-law,
who may make the daughter's bed a stepping-stone
to reach the father's crown. Oxford, I
have spoken more freely than I am wont, perhaps
more freely than I ought&mdash;but I hold some men
trustworthy, and believe you, Sir John de Vere,
to be one of them."</p>

<p>The English nobleman bowed, and was about to
leave his presence, but the Duke presently recalled
him.</p>

<p>"There is one thing more, Oxford.&mdash;The
cession of Provence is not quite enough. René
and Margaret must disavow this hot-brained
Ferrand de Vaudemont, who is making some
foolish stir in Lorraine, in right of his mother
Yolande."</p>

<p>"My lord," said Oxford, "Ferrand is the grandson
of King René, the nephew of Queen Margaret;
but yet"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But yet, by St. George, his rights, as he calls
them, on Lorraine must positively be disowned.
You talk of their family feelings, while you are
urging me to make war on my own brother-in-law!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>"René's best apology for deserting his grandson,"
answered Oxford, "will be his total inability
to support and assist him. I will communicate
your Grace's condition, though it is a hard one."</p>

<p>So saying, he left the pavilion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i5">I humbly thank your Highness,</p>
<p>And am right glad to catch this good occasion</p>
<p>Most thoroughly to be winnow'd, where my chaff</p>
<p>And corn shall fly asunder.</p>

<p class="i7"><i>King Henry VIII.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>Colvin, the English officer, to whom the Duke of
Burgundy, with splendid pay and appointments,
committed the charge of his artillery, was owner
of the tent assigned for the Englishman's lodging,
and received the Earl of Oxford with the respect
due to his rank, and to the Duke's especial orders
upon that subject. He had been himself a follower
of the Lancaster faction, and of course was
well disposed towards one of the very few men of
distinction whom he had known personally, and
who had constantly adhered to that family through
the train of misfortunes by which they seemed to
be totally overwhelmed. A repast, of which his
son had already partaken, was offered to the Earl
by Colvin, who omitted not to recommend, by
precept and example, the good wine of Burgundy,
from which the sovereign of the province was
himself obliged to refrain.</p>

<p>"His Grace shows command of passion in that,"
said Colvin. "For, sooth to speak, and only conversing
betwixt friends, his temper grows too
headlong to bear the spur which a cup of cordial
beverage gives to the blood, and he, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
wisely restricts himself to such liquid as may cool
rather than inflame his natural fire of disposition."</p>

<p>"I can perceive as much," said the Lancastrian
noble. "When I first knew the noble Duke, who
was then Earl of Charolois, his temper, though
always sufficiently fiery, was calmness to the
impetuosity which he now displays on the smallest
contradiction. Such is the course of an uninterrupted
flow of prosperity. He has ascended, by
his own courage and the advantage of circumstances,
from the doubtful place of a feudatory and
tributary prince, to rank with the most powerful
sovereigns in Europe, and to assume independent
majesty. But I trust the noble starts of generosity
which atoned for his wilful and wayward temper
are not more few than formerly?"</p>

<p>"I have good right to say that they are not,"
replied the soldier of fortune, who understood
generosity in the restricted sense of liberality.
"The Duke is a noble and open-handed master."</p>

<p>"I trust his bounty is conferred on men who are
as faithful and steady in their service as you,
Colvin, have ever been. But I see a change in
your army. I know the banners of most of the
old houses in Burgundy&mdash;How is it that I observe
so few of them in the Duke's camp? I see flags,
and pennons, and pennoncelles; but even to me,
who have been so many years acquainted with the
nobility both of France and Flanders, their bearings
are unknown."</p>

<p>"My noble Lord of Oxford," answered the officer,
"it ill becomes a man who lives on the Duke's
pay to censure his conduct; but his Highness hath
of late trusted too much, as it seems to me, to the
hired arms of foreign levies, and too little to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
own native subjects and retainers. He holds it
better to take into his pay large bands of German
and Italian mercenary soldiers, than to repose confidence
in the knights and squires who are bound
to him by allegiance and feudal faith. He uses
the aid of his own subjects but as the means of
producing him sums of money, which he bestows
on his hired troops. The Germans are honest
knaves enough while regularly paid; but Heaven
preserve me from the Duke's Italian bands, and
that Campo-basso their leader, who waits but the
highest price to sell his Highness like a sheep for
the shambles!"</p>

<p>"Think you so ill of him?" demanded the Earl.</p>

<p>"So very ill indeed, that I believe," replied
Colvin, "there is no sort of treachery which the
heart can devise, or the arm perpetrate, that hath
not ready reception in his breast, and prompt
execution at his hand. It is painful, my lord, for
an honest Englishman like me to serve in an army
where such traitors have command. But what can
I do, unless I could once more find me a soldier's
occupation in my native country? I often hope it
will please merciful Heaven again to awaken those
brave civil wars in my own dear England, where
all was fair fighting, and treason was unheard of."</p>

<p>Lord Oxford gave his host to understand, that
there was a possibility that his pious wish of
living and dying in his own country, and in the
practice of his profession, was not to be despaired of.
Meantime he requested of him, that early on the
next morning he would procure him a pass and
an escort for his son, whom he was compelled to
despatch forthwith to Nancy, the residence of
King René.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>"What!" said Colvin, "is my young Lord of
Oxford to take a degree in the Court of Love? for
no other business is listened to at King René's
capital, save love and poetry."</p>

<p>"I am not ambitious of such distinction for
him, my good host," answered Oxford; "but Queen
Margaret is with her father, and it is but fitting
that the youth should kiss her hand."</p>

<p>"Enough spoken," said the veteran Lancastrian.
"I trust, though winter is fast approaching,
the Red Rose may bloom in spring."</p>

<p>He then ushered the Earl of Oxford to the partition
of the tent which he was to occupy, in which
there was a couch for Arthur also&mdash;their host, as
Colvin might be termed, assuring them that, with
peep of day, horses and faithful attendants should
be ready to speed the youth on his journey to
Nancy.</p>

<p>"And now, Arthur," said his father, "we must
part once more. I dare give thee, in this land of
danger, no written communication to my mistress,
Queen Margaret; but say to her, that I have found
the Duke of Burgundy wedded to his own views of
interest, but not averse to combine them with
hers. Say, that I have little doubt that he will
grant us the required aid, but not without the
expected resignation in his favour by herself and
King René. Say, I would never have recommended
such a sacrifice for the precarious chance
of overthrowing the House of York, but that I am
satisfied that France and Burgundy are hanging
like vultures over Provence, and that the one or
other, or both princes, are ready, on her father's
demise, to pounce on such possessions as they
have reluctantly spared to him during his life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
An accommodation with Burgundy may therefore,
on the one hand, insure his active co-operation
in the attempt on England; and, on the other, if
our high-spirited princess complies not with the
Duke's request, the justice of her cause will give
no additional security to her hereditary claims on
her father's dominions. Bid Queen Margaret,
therefore, unless she should have changed her
views, obtain King René's formal deed of cession,
conveying his estates to the Duke of Burgundy,
with her Majesty's consent. The necessary provisions
to the King and to herself may be filled up
at her Grace's pleasure, or they may be left blank.
I can trust to the Duke's generosity to their being
suitably arranged. All that I fear is, that Charles
may embroil himself"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"In some silly exploit, necessary for his own
honour and the safety of his dominions," answered
a voice behind the lining of the tent; "and, by
doing so, attend to his own affairs more than to
ours? Ha, Sir Earl?"</p>

<p>At the same time the curtain was drawn aside,
and a person entered, in whom, though clothed
with the jerkin and bonnet of a private soldier of
the Walloon guard, Oxford instantly recognised
the Duke of Burgundy's harsh features and fierce
eyes, as they sparkled from under the fur and
feather with which the cap was ornamented.</p>

<p>Arthur, who knew not the Prince's person,
started at the intrusion, and laid his hand on
his dagger; but his father made a signal which
stayed his hand, and he gazed with wonder on the
solemn respect with which the Earl received the
intrusive soldier. The first word informed him of
the cause.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>"If this masking be done in proof of my faith,
noble Duke, permit me to say it is superfluous."</p>

<p>"Nay, Oxford," answered the Duke, "I was a
courteous spy; for I ceased to play the eavesdropper,
at the very moment when I had reason to
expect you were about to say something to anger
me."</p>

<p>"As I am a true Knight, my Lord Duke, if you
had remained behind the arras, you would only
have heard the same truths which I am ready to
tell in your Grace's presence, though it may have
chanced they might have been more bluntly
expressed."</p>

<p>"Well, speak them then, in whatever phrase
thou wilt&mdash;they lie in their throats that say
Charles of Burgundy was ever offended by advice
from a well-meaning friend."</p>

<p>"I would then have said," replied the English
Earl, "that all which Margaret of Anjou had to
apprehend, was that the Duke of Burgundy, when
buckling on his armour to win Provence for himself,
and to afford to her his powerful assistance
to assert her rights in England, was likely to be
withdrawn from such high objects by an imprudently
eager desire to avenge himself of imaginary
affronts, offered to him, as he supposed, by certain
confederacies of Alpine mountaineers, over whom
it is impossible to gain any important advantage,
or acquire reputation, while, on the contrary, there
is a risk of losing both. These men dwell amongst
rocks and deserts which are almost inaccessible,
and subsist in a manner so rude, that the poorest
of your subjects would starve if subjected to such
diet. They are formed by nature to be the garrison
of the mountain-fortresses in which she has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
placed them;&mdash;for Heaven's sake meddle not with
them, but follow forth your own nobler and more
important objects, without stirring a nest of hornets,
which, once in motion, may sting you into
madness."</p>

<p>The Duke had promised patience, and endeavoured
to keep his word; but the swoln muscles
of his face, and his flashing eyes, showed how
painful to him it was to suppress his resentment.</p>

<p>"You are misinformed, my lord," he said;
"these men are not the inoffensive herdsmen and
peasants you are pleased to suppose them. If they
were, I might afford to despise them. But, flushed
with some victories over the sluggish Austrians,
they have shaken off all reverence for authority,
assume airs of independence, form leagues, make
inroads, storm towns, doom and execute men of
noble birth at their pleasure.&mdash;Thou art dull, and
look'st as if thou dost not apprehend me. To
rouse thy English blood, and make thee sympathise
with my feelings to these mountaineers,
know that these Swiss are very Scots to my dominions
in their neighbourhood; poor, proud,
ferocious; easily offended, because they gain by
war; ill to be appeased, because they nourish deep
revenge; ever ready to seize the moment of advantage,
and attack a neighbour when he is engaged
in other affairs. The same unquiet, perfidious,
and inveterate enemies that the Scots are to England,
are the Swiss to Burgundy and to my allies.
What say you? Can I undertake anything of consequence
till I have crushed the pride of such a
people? It will be but a few days' work. I will
grasp the mountain-hedgehog, prickles and all,
with my steel-gauntlet."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>"Your Grace will then have shorter work with
them," replied the disguised nobleman, "than our
English Kings have had with Scotland. The wars
there have lasted so long, and proved so bloody,
that wise men regret we ever began them."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the Duke, "I will not dishonour
the Scots by comparing them in all respects to
these mountain-churls of the Cantons. The Scots
have blood and gentry among them, and we have
seen many examples of both; these Swiss are a
mere brood of peasants, and the few gentlemen of
birth they can boast must hide their distinction
in the dress and manners of clowns. They will, I
think, scarce stand against a charge of Hainaulters."</p>

<p>"Not if the Hainaulters find ground to ride
upon. But"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nay, to silence your scruples," said the Duke,
interrupting him, "know, that these people encourage,
by their countenance and aid, the formation
of the most dangerous conspiracies in my
dominions. Look here&mdash;I told you that my
officer, Sir Archibald de Hagenbach, was murdered
when the town of Brisach was treacherously taken
by these harmless Switzers of yours. And here
is a scroll of parchment, which announces that
my servant was murdered by doom of the Vehme-gericht,
a band of secret assassins, whom I will
not permit to meet in any part of my dominions.
Oh, could I but catch them above ground as they
are found lurking below, they should know what
the life of a nobleman is worth! Then, look at
the insolence of their attestation."</p>

<p>The scroll bore, with the day and date adjected,
that judgment had been done on Archibald de
Hagenbach, for tyranny, violence, and oppression,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
by order of the Holy Vehme, and that it was
executed by their officials, who were responsible
for the same to their tribunal alone. It was countersigned
in red ink, with the badges of the Secret
Society, a coil of ropes and a drawn dagger.</p>

<p>"This document I found stuck to my toilette
with a knife," said the Duke; "another trick by
which they give mystery to their murderous
jugglery."</p>

<p>The thought of what he had undergone in John
Mengs's house, and reflections upon the extent
and omnipresence of these Secret Associations,
struck even the brave Englishman with an involuntary
shudder.</p>

<p>"For the sake of every saint in heaven," he
said, "forbear, my lord, to speak of these tremendous
societies, whose creatures are above, beneath,
and around us. No man is secure of his life,
however guarded, if it be sought by a man who is
careless of his own. You are surrounded by Germans,
Italians, and other strangers&mdash;How many
amongst these may be bound by the secret ties
which withdraw men from every other social bond,
to unite them together in one inextricable though
secret compact? Beware, noble Prince, of the
situation on which your throne is placed, though
it still exhibits all the splendour of power, and all
the solidity of foundation that belongs to so august
a structure. I&mdash;the friend of thy house&mdash;were
it with my dying breath&mdash;must needs tell thee,
that the Swiss hang like an avalanche over thy
head; and the Secret Associations work beneath
thee like the first throes of the coming earthquake.
Provoke not the contest, and the snow will rest
undisturbed on the mountain-side&mdash;the agitation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
of the subterranean vapours will be hushed to rest;
but a single word of defiance, or one flash of indignant
scorn, may call their terrors into instant
action."</p>

<p>"You speak," said the Duke, "with more awe of
a pack of naked churls, and a band of midnight
assassins, than I have seen you show for real
danger. Yet I will not scorn your counsel&mdash;I
will hear the Swiss envoys patiently, and I will
not, if I can help it, show the contempt with
which I cannot but regard their pretensions to
treat as independent states. On the Secret Associations
I will be silent, till time gives me the
means of acting in combination with the Emperor,
the Diet, and the Princes of the Empire, that they
may be driven from all their burrows at once.&mdash;Ha,
Sir Earl, said I well?"</p>

<p>"It is well thought, my lord, but it may be unhappily
spoken. You are in a position where one
word overheard by a traitor might produce death
and ruin."</p>

<p>"I keep no traitors about me," said Charles.
"If I thought there were such in my camp, I
would rather die by them at once, than live in
perpetual terror and suspicion."</p>

<p>"Your Highness's ancient followers and servants,"
said the Earl, "speak unfavourably of the
Count of Campo-basso, who holds so high a rank
in your confidence."</p>

<p>"Ay," replied the Duke, with composure, "it
is easy to decry the most faithful servant in a
court by the unanimous hatred of all the others.
I warrant me your bull-headed countryman,
Colvin, has been railing against the Count like
the rest of them, for Campo-basso sees nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
amiss in any department but he reports it to me
without fear or favour. And then his opinions
are cast so much in the same mould with my own,
that I can hardly get him to enlarge upon what he
best understands, if it seems in any respect different
from my sentiments. Add to this, a noble
person, grace, gaiety, skill in the exercises of war,
and in the courtly arts of peace&mdash;such is Campo-basso;
and, being such, is he not a gem for a
prince's cabinet?"</p>

<p>"The very materials out of which a favourite is
formed," answered the Earl of Oxford, "but something
less adapted for making a faithful counsellor."</p>

<p>"Why, thou mistrustful fool," said the Duke,
"must I tell thee the very inmost secret respecting
this man, Campo-basso, and will nothing short of
it stay these imaginary suspicions which thy new
trade of an itinerant merchant hath led thee to
entertain so rashly?"</p>

<p>"If your Highness honours me with your confidence,"
said the Earl of Oxford, "I can only say
that my fidelity shall deserve it."</p>

<p>"Know, then, thou misbelieving mortal, that
my good friend and brother, Louis of France, sent
me private information through no less a person
than his famous barber, Oliver le Diable, that
Campo-basso had for a certain sum offered to put
my person into his hands, alive or dead.&mdash;You
start?"</p>

<p>"I do indeed&mdash;recollecting your Highness's
practice of riding out lightly armed, and with a
very small attendance, to reconnoitre the ground
and visit the outposts, and therefore how easily
such a treacherous device might be carried into
execution."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>"Pshaw!" answered the Duke.&mdash;"Thou seest
the danger as if it were real, whereas nothing can
be more certain than that, if my cousin of France
had ever received such an offer, he would have
been the last person to have put me on my guard
against the attempt. No&mdash;he knows the value
I set on Campo-basso's services, and forged the
accusation to deprive me of them."</p>

<p>"And yet, my lord," replied the English Earl,
"your Highness, by my counsel, will not unnecessarily
or impatiently fling aside your armour of
proof, or ride without the escort of some score of
your trusty Walloons."</p>

<p>"Tush, man, thou wouldst make a carbonado of
a fever-stirred wretch like myself, betwixt the
bright iron and the burning sun. But I will be
cautious though I jest thus&mdash;and you, young man,
may assure my cousin, Margaret of Anjou, that I
will consider her affairs as my own. And remember,
youth, that the secrets of princes are fatal
gifts, if he to whom they are imparted blaze them
abroad; but if duly treasured up, they enrich the
bearer. And thou shalt have cause to say so, if
thou canst bring back with thee from Aix the deed
of resignation of which thy father hath spoken.&mdash;Good-night&mdash;good-night!"</p>

<p>He left the apartment.</p>

<p>"You have just seen," said the Earl of Oxford
to his son, "a sketch of this extraordinary prince,
by his own pencil. It is easy to excite his ambition
or thirst of power, but well-nigh impossible
to limit him to the just measures by which it is
most likely to be gratified. He is ever like the
young archer, startled from his mark by some
swallow crossing his eye, even careless as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
draws the string. Now irregularly and offensively
suspicious&mdash;now unreservedly lavish of his confidence&mdash;not
long since the enemy of the line of
Lancaster, and the ally of her deadly foe&mdash;now
its last and only stay and hope. God mend all!&mdash;It
is a weary thing to look on the game and see
how it might be won, while we are debarred by
the caprice of others from the power of playing
it according to our own skill. How much must
depend on the decision of Duke Charles upon the
morrow, and how little do I possess the power of
influencing him, either for his own safety or our
advantage! Good-night, my son, and let us trust
events to Him who alone can control them."

<p>You tread upon my patience.</p>

<p class="i12"><i>Henry IV.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The dawn of morning roused the banished Earl
of Oxford and his son, and its lights were scarce
abroad on the eastern heaven, ere their host,
Colvin, entered with an attendant, bearing some
bundles, which he placed on the floor of the tent,
and instantly retired. The officer of the Duke's
ordnance then announced that he came with a
message from the Duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p>"His Highness," he said, "has sent four stout
yeomen, with a commission of credence to my
young master of Oxford, and an ample purse of
gold, to furnish his expenses to Aix, and while
his affairs may detain him there. Also a letter of
credence to King René, to insure his reception,
and two suits of honour for his use, as for an English
gentleman, desirous to witness the festive
solemnities of Provence, and in whose safety the
Duke deigns to take deep interest. His further
affairs there, if he hath any, his Highness recommends
to him to manage with prudence and secrecy.
His Highness hath also sent a couple of
horses for his use,&mdash;one an ambling jennet for
the road, and another a strong barbed horse of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Flanders, in case he hath aught to do. It will be
fitting that my young master change his dress, and
assume attire more near his proper rank. His
attendants know the road, and have power, in case
of need, to summon, in the Duke's name, assistance
from all faithful Burgundians. I have but to
add, the sooner the young gentleman sets forward,
it will be the better sign of a successful journey."</p>

<p>"I am ready to mount, the instant that I have
changed my dress," said Arthur.</p>

<p>"And I," said his father, "have no wish to
detain him on the service in which he is now
employed. Neither he nor I will say more than
God be with you. How and where we are to meet
again, who can tell?"</p>

<p>"I believe," said Colvin, "that must rest on the
motions of the Duke, which, perchance, are not
yet determined upon; but his Highness depends
upon your remaining with him, my noble lord, till
the affairs of which you come to treat may be more
fully decided. Something I have for your lordship's
private ear, when your son hath parted on
his journey."</p>

<p>While Colvin was thus talking with his father,
Arthur, who was not above half-dressed when he
entered the tent, had availed himself of an obscure
corner, in which he exchanged the plain garb belonging
to his supposed condition as a merchant, for
such a riding-suit as became a young man of some
quality attached to the Court of Burgundy. It
was not without a natural sensation of pleasure
that the youth resumed an apparel suitable to his
birth, and which no one was personally more fitted
to become; but it was with much deeper feeling
that he hastily, and as secretly as possible, flung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
round his neck, and concealed under the collar
and folds of his ornamented doublet, a small thin
chain of gold, curiously linked in what was called
Morisco work. This was the contents of the
parcel which Anne of Geierstein had indulged his
feelings, and perhaps her own, by putting into his
hands as they parted. The chain was secured by
a slight plate of gold, on which a bodkin, or a
point of a knife, had traced on the one side, in
distinct though light characters, <span class="smcap">Adieu for ever!</span>
while, on the reverse, there was much more obscurely
traced, the word <span class="smcap">Remember!</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">A. von G.</span></p>

<p>All who may read this are, have been, or will
be, lovers; and there is none, therefore, who may
not be able to comprehend why this token was
carefully suspended around Arthur's neck, so that
the inscription might rest on the region of his
heart, without the interruption of any substance
which could prevent the pledge from being agitated
by every throb of that busy organ.</p>

<p>This being hastily insured, a few minutes completed
the rest of his toilette; and he kneeled before
his father to ask his blessing, and his further
commands for Aix.</p>

<p>His father blessed him almost inarticulately,
and then said, with recovered firmness, that he
was already possessed of all the knowledge necessary
for success on his mission.</p>

<p>"When you can bring me the deeds wanted," he
whispered with more firmness, "you will find me
near the person of the Duke of Burgundy."</p>

<p>They went forth of the tent in silence, and
found before it the four Burgundian yeomen, tall
and active-looking men, ready mounted themselves,
and holding two saddled horses&mdash;the one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
accoutred for war, the other a spirited jennet, for
the purposes of the journey. One of them led a
sumpter-horse, on which Colvin informed Arthur
he would find the change of habit necessary when
he should arrive at Aix; and at the same time
delivered to him a heavy purse of gold.</p>

<p>"Thiebault," he continued, pointing out the
eldest of the attendant troopers, "may be trusted&mdash;I
will be warrant for his sagacity and fidelity.
The other three are picked men, who will not fear
their skin-cutting."</p>

<p>Arthur vaulted into the saddle with a sensation
of pleasure, which was natural to a young cavalier
who had not for many months felt a spirited horse
beneath him. The lively jennet reared with impatience.
Arthur, sitting firm on his seat, as if
he had been a part of the animal, only said, "Ere
we are long acquainted, thy spirit, my fair roan,
will be something more tamed."</p>

<p>"One word more, my son," said his father, and
whispered in Arthur's ear, as he stooped from the
saddle; "if you receive a letter from me, do not
think yourself fully acquainted with the contents
till the paper has been held opposite to a hot
fire."</p>

<p>Arthur bowed, and motioned to the elder trooper
to lead the way, when all, giving rein to their
horses, rode off through the encampment at a
round pace, the young leader signing an adieu to
his father and Colvin.</p>

<p>The Earl stood like a man in a dream, following
his son with his eyes, in a kind of reverie, which
was only broken when Colvin said, "I marvel not,
my lord, that you are anxious about my young master;
he is a gallant youth, well worth a father's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
caring for, and the times we live in are both false
and bloody."</p>

<p>"God and St. Mary be my witness," said the
Earl, "that if I grieve, it is not for my own house
only;&mdash;if I am anxious, it is not for the sake of
my own son alone;&mdash;but it is hard to risk a last
stake in a cause so perilous.&mdash;What commands
brought you from the Duke?"</p>

<p>"His Grace," said Colvin, "will get on horseback
after he has breakfasted. He sends you some
garments, which, if not fitting your quality, are
yet nearer to suitable apparel than those you now
wear, and he desires that, observing your incognito
as an English merchant of eminence, you will join
him in his cavalcade to Dijon, where he is to
receive the answer of the Estates of Burgundy concerning
matters submitted to their consideration,
and thereafter give public audience to the Deputies
from Switzerland. His Highness has charged me
with the care of finding you suitable accommodation
during the ceremonies of the day, which, he
thinks, you will, as a stranger, be pleased to look
upon. But he probably told you all this himself,
for I think you saw him last night in disguise&mdash;Nay,
look as strange as you will&mdash;the Duke plays
that trick too often to be able to do it with secrecy;
the very horse-boys know him while he
traverses the tents of the common soldiery, and
sutler women give him the name of the spied spy.
If it were only honest Harry Colvin who knew
this, it should not cross his lips. But it is practised
too openly, and too widely known. Come,
noble lord, though I must teach my tongue to
forego that courtesy, will you along to breakfast?"</p>

<p>The meal, according to the practice of the time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
was a solemn and solid one; and a favoured officer
of the Great Duke of Burgundy lacked no means,
it may be believed, of rendering due hospitality to
a guest having claims of such high respect. But
ere the breakfast was over a clamorous flourish
of trumpets announced that the Duke, with his
attendants and retinue, were sounding to horse.
Philipson, as he was still called, was, in the name
of the Duke, presented with a stately charger, and
with his host mingled in the splendid assembly
which began to gather in front of the Duke's
pavilion. In a few minutes the Prince himself
issued forth, in the superb dress of the Order of
the Golden Fleece, of which his father Philip
had been the founder, and Charles was himself the
patron and sovereign. Several of his courtiers
were dressed in the same magnificent robes, and,
with their followers and attendants, displayed so
much wealth and splendour of appearance as to
warrant the common saying that the Duke of
Burgundy maintained the most magnificent court
in Christendom. The officers of his household
attended in their order, together with heralds and
pursuivants, the grotesque richness of whose habits
had a singular effect among those of the high
clergy in their albes and dalmatiques, and of the
knights and crown vassals who were arrayed in
armour. Among these last, who were variously
equipped, according to the different character of
their service, rode Oxford, but in a peaceful habit,
neither so plain as to be out of place amongst such
splendour, nor so rich as to draw on him a special
or particular degree of attention. He rode by the
side of Colvin, his tall muscular figure and deep-marked
features forming a strong contrast to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
rough, almost ignoble, cast of countenance, and
stout thick-set form, of the less distinguished soldier
of fortune.</p>

<p>Ranged into a solemn procession, the rear of
which was closed by a guard of two hundred
picked arquebusiers, a description of soldiers who
were just then coming into notice, and as many
mounted men-at-arms, the Duke and his retinue,
leaving the barriers of the camp, directed their
march to the town, or rather city, of Dijon, in
those days the capital of all Burgundy.</p>

<p>It was a town well secured with walls and
ditches, which last were filled by means of a small
river, named the Ousche, which combines its
waters for that purpose with a torrent called
Suzon. Four gates, with appropriate barbicans,
outworks, and drawbridges, corresponded nearly to
the cardinal points of the compass, and gave admission
to the city. The number of towers, which
stood high above its walls, and defended them at
different angles, was thirty-three; and the walls
themselves, which exceeded in most places the
height of thirty feet, were built of stones hewn
and squared, and were of great thickness. This
stately city was surrounded on the outside with
hills covered with vineyards, while from within
its walls rose the towers of many noble buildings,
both public and private, as well as the steeples of
magnificent churches, and of well-endowed convents,
attesting the wealth and devotion of the
House of Burgundy.</p>

<p>When the trumpets of the Duke's procession
had summoned the burgher guard at the gate of St.
Nicholas, the drawbridge fell, the portcullis rose,
the people shouted joyously, the windows were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
hung with tapestry, and as, in the midst of his
retinue, Charles himself came riding on a milk-white
steed, attended only by six pages under
fourteen years old, with each a gilded partisan in
his hand, the acclamations with which he was
received on all sides showed that, if some instances
of misrule had diminished his popularity, enough
of it remained to render his reception into his
capital decorous at least, if not enthusiastic. It
is probable that the veneration attached to his
father's memory counteracted for a long time the
unfavourable effect which some of his own actions
were calculated to produce on the public mind.</p>

<p>The procession halted before a large Gothic
building in the centre of Dijon. This was then
called Maison du Duc, as, after the union of Burgundy
with France, it was termed Maison du Roy.
The Maire of Dijon attended on the steps before
this palace, accompanied by his official brethren,
and escorted by a hundred able-bodied citizens, in
black velvet cloaks, bearing half-pikes in their
hands. The Maire kneeled to kiss the stirrup of
the Duke, and at the moment when Charles descended
from his horse every bell in the city commenced
so thundering a peal, that they might
almost have awakened the dead who slept in the
vicinity of the steeples, which rocked with their
clangour. Under the influence of this stunning
peal of welcome, the Duke entered the great hall
of the building, at the upper end of which were
erected a throne for the sovereign, seats for his
more distinguished officers of state and higher vassals,
with benches behind for persons of less note.
On one of these, but in a spot from which he
might possess a commanding view of the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
assembly, as well as of the Duke himself, Colvin
placed the noble Englishman; and Charles, whose
quick stern eye glanced rapidly over the party
when they were seated, seemed, by a nod so slight
as to be almost imperceptible to those around him,
to give his approbation of the arrangement adopted.</p>

<p>When the Duke and his assistants were seated
and in order, the Maire, again approaching, in the
most humble manner, and kneeling on the lowest
step of the ducal throne, requested to know if his
Highness's leisure permitted him to hear the inhabitants
of his capital express their devoted zeal
to his person, and to accept the benevolence which,
in the shape of a silver cup filled with gold pieces,
he had the distinguished honour to place before
his feet, in name of the citizens and community
of Dijon.</p>

<p>Charles, who at no time affected much courtesy,
answered briefly and bluntly, with a voice which
was naturally harsh and dissonant, "All things in
their order, good Master Maire. Let us first hear
what the Estates of Burgundy have to say to us.
We will then listen to the burghers of Dijon."</p>

<p>The Maire rose and retired, bearing in his hand
the silver cup, and experiencing probably some
vexation, as well as surprise, that its contents had
not secured an instant and gracious acceptance.</p>

<p>"I expected," said Duke Charles, "to have met
at this hour and place our Estates of the duchy of
Burgundy, or a deputation of them, with an answer
to our message conveyed to them three days since
by our chancellor. Is there no one here on their
part?"</p>

<p>The Maire, as none else made any attempt to
answer, said that the members of the Estates had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
been in close deliberation the whole of that morning,
and doubtless would instantly wait upon his
Highness when they heard that he had honoured
the town with his presence.</p>

<p>"Go, Toison d'Or," said the Duke to the herald
of the Order of the Golden Fleece,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
 "bear to these
gentlemen the tidings that we desire to know the
end of their deliberations; and that neither in
courtesy nor in loyalty can they expect us to wait
long. Be round with them, Sir Herald, or we
shall be as round with you."</p>

<p>While the herald was absent on his mission, we
may remind our readers that in all feudalised
countries (that is to say, in almost all Europe
during the Middle Ages) an ardent spirit of liberty
pervaded the constitution; and the only fault that
could be found was, that the privileges and freedom
for which the great vassals contended did not
sufficiently descend to the lower orders of society,
or extend protection to those who were most likely
to need it. The two first ranks in the estate, the
nobles and clergy, enjoyed high and important
privileges, and even the third estate, or citizens,
had this immunity in peculiar, that no new duties,
customs, or taxes of any kind could be exacted
from them save by their own consent.</p>

<p>The memory of Duke Philip, the father of
Charles, was dear to the Burgundians; for during
twenty years that sage prince had maintained his
rank amongst the sovereigns of Europe with much
dignity, and had accumulated treasure without
exacting or receiving any great increase of supplies
from the rich countries which he governed.
But the extravagant schemes and immoderate expense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
of Duke Charles had already excited the suspicion
of his Estates; and the mutual good-will
betwixt the prince and people began to be exchanged
for suspicion and distrust on the one
side, and defiance on the other. The refractory
disposition of the Estates had of late increased;
for they had disapproved of various wars in
which their Duke had needlessly embarked, and
from his levying such large bodies of mercenary
troops, they came to suspect he might finally
employ the wealth voted to him by his subjects
for the undue extension of his royal prerogative,
and the destruction of the liberties of the people.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Duke's uniform success
in enterprises which appeared desperate as well
as difficult, esteem for the frankness and openness
of his character, and dread of the obstinacy and
headstrong tendency of a temper which could seldom
bear persuasion, and never endured opposition,
still threw awe and terror around the throne,
which was materially aided by the attachment of
the common people to the person of the present
Duke and to the memory of his father. It had
been understood that upon the present occasion
there was strong opposition amongst the Estates to
the system of taxation proposed on the part of the
Duke, and the issue was expected with considerable
anxiety by the Duke's counsellors, and with
fretful impatience by the sovereign himself.</p>

<p>After a space of about ten minutes had elapsed,
the Chancellor of Burgundy, who was Archbishop
of Vienne, and a prelate of high rank, entered the
hall with his train; and passing behind the ducal
throne to occupy one of the most distinguished
places in the assembly, he stopped for a moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
to urge his master to receive the answer of his
Estates in a private manner, giving him at the
same time to understand that the result of the
deliberations had been by no means satisfactory.</p>

<p>"By St. George of Burgundy, my Lord Archbishop,"
answered the Duke, sternly and aloud,
"we are not a prince of a mind so paltry that we
need to shun the moody looks of a discontented
and insolent faction. If the Estates of Burgundy
send a disobedient and disloyal answer to our
paternal message, let them deliver it in open
court, that the assembled people may learn how
to decide between their Duke and those petty yet
intriguing spirits, who would interfere with our
authority."</p>

<p>The chancellor bowed gravely, and took his
seat; while the English Earl observed, that most
of the members of the assembly, excepting such as
in doing so could not escape the Duke's notice,
passed some observations to their neighbours,
which were received with a half-expressed nod,
shrug, or shake of the head, as men treat a proposal
upon which it is dangerous to decide. At
the same time, Toison d'Or, who acted as master
of the ceremonies, introduced into the hall a
committee of the Estates, consisting of twelve
members, four from each branch of the Estates,
announced as empowered to deliver the answer of
that assembly to the Duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p>When the deputation entered the hall, Charles
arose from his throne, according to ancient custom,
and taking from his head his bonnet, charged with
a huge plume of feathers, "Health and welcome,"
he said, "to my good subjects of the Estates of
Burgundy!" All the numerous train of courtiers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
rose and uncovered their heads with the same ceremony.
The members of the States then dropped
on one knee, the four ecclesiastics, among whom
Oxford recognised the Black Priest of St. Paul's,
approaching nearest to the Duke's person, the
nobles kneeling behind them, and the burgesses
in the rear of the whole.</p>

<p>"Noble Duke," said the Priest of St. Paul's,
"will it best please you to hear the answer of your
good and loyal Estates of Burgundy by the voice
of one member speaking for the whole, or by three
persons, each delivering the sense of the body to
which he belongs?"</p>

<p>"As you will," said the Duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p>"A priest, a noble, and a free burgher," said
the Churchman, still on one knee, "will address
your Highness in succession. For though, blessed
be the God who leads brethren to dwell together
in unity! we are agreed in the general answer, yet
each body of the Estates may have special and
separate reasons to allege for the common opinion."</p>

<p>"We will hear you separately," said Duke
Charles, casting his hat upon his head, and throwing
himself carelessly back into his seat. At the
same time, all who were of noble blood, whether in
the committee or amongst the spectators, vouched
their right to be peers of their sovereign by assuming
their bonnets; and a cloud of waving plumes
at once added grace and dignity to the assembly.</p>

<p>When the Duke resumed his seat, the deputation
arose from their knees, and the Black Priest
of St. Paul's, again stepping forth, addressed him
in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My Lord Duke, your loyal and faithful clergy
have considered your Highness's proposal to lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
a talliage on your people, in order to make war
on the confederate Cantons in the country of the
Alps. The quarrel, my liege lord, seems to your
clergy an unjust and oppressive one on your Highness's
part; nor can they hope that God will bless
those who arm in it. They are therefore compelled
to reject your Highness's proposal."</p>

<p>The Duke's eye lowered gloomily on the deliverer
of this unpalatable message. He shook his
head with one of those stern and menacing looks
which the harsh composition of his features rendered
them peculiarly qualified to express. "You
have spoken, Sir Priest," was the only reply which
he deigned to make.</p>

<p>One of the four nobles, the Sire de Myrebeau,
then expressed himself thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your Highness has asked of your faithful
nobles to consent to new imposts and exactions,
to be levied through Burgundy, for the raising of
additional bands of hired soldiers for the maintenance
of the quarrels of the State. My lord, the
swords of the Burgundian nobles, knights, and
gentlemen have been ever at your Highness's command,
as those of our ancestors have been readily
wielded for your predecessors. In your Highness's
just quarrel we will go farther, and fight firmer,
than any hired fellows who can be procured,
whether from France, or Germany, or Italy. We
will not give our consent that the people should
be taxed for paying mercenaries to discharge that
military duty which it is alike our pride and our
exclusive privilege to render."</p>

<p>"You have spoken, Sire de Myrebeau," were
again the only words of the Duke's reply. He
uttered them slowly and with deliberation, as if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
afraid lest some phrase of imprudent violence
should escape along with what he purposed to say.
Oxford thought he cast a glance towards him before
he spoke, as if the consciousness of his presence
was some additional restraint on his passion.
"Now, Heaven grant," he said to himself, "that
this opposition may work its proper effect, and
induce the Duke to renounce an imprudent attempt,
so hazardous and so unnecessary!"</p>

<p>While he muttered these thoughts, the Duke
made a sign to one of the <i>tiers état</i>, or commons,
to speak in his turn. The person who obeyed the
signal was Martin Block, a wealthy butcher and
grazier of Dijon. His words were these: "Noble
Prince, our fathers were the dutiful subjects of
your predecessors; we are the same to you; our
children will be alike the liegemen of your successors.
But, touching the request your chancellor
has made to us, it is such as our ancestors
never complied with; such as we are determined
to refuse, and such as will never be conceded by
the Estates of Burgundy, to any prince whatsoever,
even to the end of time."</p>

<p>Charles had borne with impatient silence the
speeches of the two former orators, but this blunt
and hardy reply of the third Estate excited him
beyond what his nature could endure. He gave
way to the impetuosity of his disposition, stamped
on the floor till the throne shook, and the high
vault rung over their heads, and overwhelmed the
bold burgher with reproaches. "Beast of burden,"
he said, "am I to be stunned with thy braying
too? The nobles may claim leave to speak, for
they can fight; the clergy may use their tongues,
for it is their trade; but thou, that hast never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
shed blood, save that of bullocks, more stupid than
thou art thyself&mdash;must thou and thy herd come
hither, privileged, forsooth, to bellow at a prince's
footstool? Know, brute as thou art, that steers
are never introduced into temples but to be sacrificed,
or butchers and mechanics brought before
their sovereign, save that they may have the
honour to supply the public wants from their own
swelling hoards!"</p>

<p>A murmur of displeasure, which even the terror
of the Duke's wrath could not repress, ran through
the audience at these words; and the burgher of
Dijon, a sturdy plebeian, replied, with little reverence:
"Our purses, my Lord Duke, are our own&mdash;we
will not put the strings of them into your
Highness's hands, unless we are satisfied with the
purposes to which the money is to be applied; and
we know well how to protect our persons and our
goods against foreign ruffians and plunderers."</p>

<p>Charles was on the point of ordering the deputy
to be arrested, when, having cast his eye towards
the Earl of Oxford, whose presence, in despite of
himself, imposed a certain degree of restraint upon
him, he exchanged that piece of imprudence for
another.</p>

<p>"I see," he said, addressing the committee of
Estates, "that you are all leagued to disappoint
my purposes, and doubtless to deprive me of all
the power of a sovereign, save that of wearing a
coronet, and being served on the knee like a second
Charles the Simple, while the Estates of my kingdom
divide the power among them. But you shall
know that you have to do with Charles of Burgundy,
a prince who, though he has deigned to
consult you, is fully able to fight battles without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
the aid of his nobles, since they refuse him the
assistance of their swords&mdash;to defray the expense
without the help of his sordid burghers&mdash;and, it
may be, to find out a path to heaven without the
assistance of an ungrateful priesthood. I will
show all that are here present how little my mind
is affected, or my purpose changed, by your seditious
reply to the message with which I honoured
you.&mdash;Here, Toison d'Or, admit into our presence
these men from the confederated towns and cantons,
as they call themselves, of Switzerland."</p>

<p>Oxford, and all who really interested themselves
in the Duke's welfare, heard, with the
utmost apprehension, his resolution to give an
audience to the Swiss Envoys, prepossessed as he
was against them, and in the moment when his
mood was chafed to the uttermost by the refusal
of the Estates to grant him supplies. They were
aware that obstacles opposed to the current of his
passion were like rocks in the bed of a river,
whose course they cannot interrupt, while they
provoke it to rage and foam. All were sensible
that the die was cast, but none who were not
endowed with more than mortal prescience could
have imagined how deep was the pledge which
depended upon it. Oxford, in particular, conceived
that the execution of his plan of a descent
upon England was the principal point compromised
by the Duke in his rash obstinacy; but he suspected
not&mdash;he dreamed not of supposing&mdash;that
the life of Charles himself, and the independence
of Burgundy as a separate kingdom, hung quivering
in the same scales.

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Why, 'tis a boisterous and cruel style,</p>
<p>A style for challengers. Why, she defies us,</p>
<p>Like Turk to Christian.</p>

<p class="i10"><i>As You Like It.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The doors of the hall were now opened to the
Swiss deputies, who for the preceding hour had
been kept in attendance on the outside of the
building, without receiving the slightest of those
attentions which among civilised nations are universally
paid to the representatives of a foreign
State. Indeed, their very appearance, dressed in
coarse grey frocks, like mountain hunters or shepherds,
in the midst of an assembly blazing with
divers-coloured garments, gold and silver lace,
embroidery, and precious stones, served to confirm
the idea that they could only have come hither in
the capacity of the most humble petitioners.</p>

<p>Oxford, however, who watched closely the deportment
of his late fellow-travellers, failed not to
observe that they retained each in his own person
the character of firmness and indifference which
formerly distinguished them. Rudolph Donnerhugel
preserved his bold and haughty look; the
Banneret, the military indifference which made
him look with apparent apathy on all around
him; the burgher of Soleure was as formal and
important as ever; nor did any of the three show
themselves affected in the slightest degree by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
the splendour of the scene around them, or embarrassed
by the consideration of their own comparative
inferiority of appointments. But the noble
Landamman, on whom Oxford chiefly bent his
attention, seemed overwhelmed with a sense of the
precarious state in which his country was placed;
fearing, from the rude and unhonoured manner in
which they were received, that war was unavoidable,
while, at the same time, like a good patriot,
he mourned over the consequences of ruin to the
freedom of his country by defeat, or injury to her
simplicity and virtuous indifference of wealth, by
the introduction of foreign luxuries and the evils
attending on conquest.</p>

<p>Well acquainted with the opinions of Arnold
Biederman, Oxford could easily explain his sadness,
while his comrade Bonstetten, less capable
of comprehending his friend's feelings, looked at
him with the expression which may be seen in the
countenance of a faithful dog, when the creature
indicates sympathy with his master's melancholy,
though unable to ascertain or appreciate its cause.
A look of wonder now and then glided around the
splendid assembly on the part of all the forlorn
group, excepting Donnerhugel and the Landamman;
for the indomitable pride of the one, and
the steady patriotism of the other, could not for
even an instant be diverted by external objects
from their own deep and stern reflections.</p>

<p>After a silence of nearly five minutes, the Duke
spoke, with the haughty and harsh manner which
he might imagine belonged to his place, and which
certainly expressed his character.</p>

<p>"Men of Berne, of Schwitz, or of whatever
hamlet and wilderness you may represent, know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
that we had not honoured you, rebels as you are
to the dominion of your lawful superiors, with an
audience in our own presence, but for the intercession
of a well-esteemed friend, who has sojourned
among your mountains, and whom you may know
by the name of Philipson, an Englishman, following
the trade of a merchant, and charged with certain
valuable matters of traffic to our court. To his
intercession we have so far given way, that instead
of commanding you, according to your demerits,
to the gibbet and the wheel in the Place de Morimont,
we have condescended to receive you into
our own presence, sitting in our <i>cour plénière</i>, to
hear from you such submission as you can offer for
your outrageous storm of our town of La Ferette,
the slaughter of many of our liegemen, and the
deliberate murder of the noble knight, Archibald
of Hagenbach, executed in your presence, and by
your countenance and device. Speak&mdash;if you can
say aught in defence of your felony and treason,
either to deprecate just punishment, or crave
undeserved mercy."</p>

<p>The Landamman seemed about to answer; but
Rudolph Donnerhugel, with his characteristic
boldness and hardihood, took the task of reply on
himself. He confronted the proud Duke with an
eye unappalled, and a countenance as stern as his
own.</p>

<p>"We came not here," he said, "to compromise
our own honour, or the dignity of the free people
whom we represent, by pleading guilty in their
name, or our own, to crimes of which we are innocent.
And when you term us rebels, you must
remember, that a long train of victories, whose
history is written in the noblest blood of Austria,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
has restored to the confederacy of our communities
the freedom of which an unjust tyranny in vain
attempted to deprive us. While Austria was a
just and beneficent mistress, we served her with
our lives;&mdash;when she became oppressive and
tyrannical, we assumed independence. If she has
aught yet to claim from us, the descendants of
Tell, Faust, and Stauffacher will be as ready to
assert their liberties as their fathers were to gain
them. Your Grace&mdash;if such be your title&mdash;has
no concern with any dispute betwixt us and
Austria. For your threats of gibbet and wheel,
we are here defenceless men, on whom you may
work your pleasure; but we know how to die, and
our countrymen know how to avenge us."</p>

<p>The fiery Duke would have replied by commanding
the instant arrest, and probably the
immediate execution, of the whole deputation.
But his chancellor, availing himself of the privilege
of his office, rose, and, doffing his cap with a
deep reverence to the Duke, requested leave to
reply to the misproud young man, who had, he
said, so greatly mistaken the purpose of his Highness's
speech.</p>

<p>Charles, feeling perhaps at the moment too
much irritated to form a calm decision, threw
himself back in his chair of state, and with an
impatient and angry nod gave his chancellor permission
to speak.</p>

<p>"Young man," said that high officer, "you have
mistaken the meaning of the high and mighty sovereign
in whose presence you stand. Whatever be
the lawful rights of Austria over the revolted villages
which have flung off their allegiance to their
native superior, we have no call to enter on that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
argument. But that for which Burgundy demands
your answer is, wherefore, coming here in the
guise, and with the character, of peaceful envoys,
on affairs touching your own communities and the
rights of the Duke's subjects, you have raised war
in our peaceful dominions, stormed a fortress,
massacred its garrison, and put to death a noble
knight, its commander?&mdash;all of them actions contrary
to the law of nations, and highly deserving
of the punishment with which you have been justly
threatened, but with which I hope our gracious
sovereign will dispense, if you express some sufficient
reason for such outrageous insolence, with an
offer of due submission to his Highness's pleasure,
and satisfactory reparation for such a high injury."</p>

<p>"You are a priest, grave sir?" answered Rudolph
Donnerhugel, addressing the Chancellor of
Burgundy. "If there be a soldier in this assembly
who will avouch your charge, I challenge him to
the combat, man to man. We did not storm the
garrison of La Ferette&mdash;we were admitted into
the gates in a peaceful manner, and were there
instantly surrounded by the soldiers of the late
Archibald de Hagenbach, with the obvious purpose
of assaulting and murdering us on our peaceful
mission. I promise you there had been news of
more men dying than us. But an uproar broke
out among the inhabitants of the town, assisted, I
believe, by many neighbours, to whom the insolence
and oppression of Archibald de Hagenbach
had become odious, as to all who were within his
reach. We rendered them no assistance; and, I
trust, it was not expected that we should interfere
in the favour of men who had stood prepared to do
the worst against us. But not a pike or sword
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
belonging to us or our attendants was dipped in
Burgundian blood. Archibald de Hagenbach perished,
it is true, on a scaffold, and I saw him die
with pleasure, under a sentence pronounced by a
competent court, such as is recognised in Westphalia,
and its dependencies on this side of the
Rhine. I am not obliged to vindicate their proceedings;
but I aver, that the Duke has received
full proof of his regular sentence; and, in fine,
that it was amply deserved by oppression, tyranny,
and foul abuse of his authority, I will uphold
against all gainsayers, with the body of a man.
There lies my glove."</p>

<p>And, with an action suited to the language he
used, the stern Swiss flung his right-hand glove
on the floor of the hall. In the spirit of the age,
with the love of distinction in arms which it
nourished, and perhaps with the desire of gaining
the Duke's favour, there was a general motion
among the young Burgundians to accept the challenge,
and more than six or eight gloves were
hastily doffed by the young knights present, those
who were more remote flinging them over the heads
of the nearest, and each proclaiming his name and
title as he proffered the gage of combat.</p>

<p>"I set at all," said the daring young Swiss,
gathering the gauntlets as they fell clashing around
him. "More, gentlemen, more! a glove for every
finger! come on, one at once&mdash;fair lists, equal
judges of the field, the combat on foot, and the
weapons two-handed swords, and I will not budge
for a score of you."</p>

<p class="caption">THE DEFIANCE.<br />

<span class="s08">Drawn and Etched by R. de los Rios.</span></p>
</div>
<p>"Hold, gentlemen! on your allegiance, hold!"
said the Duke, gratified at the same time, and
somewhat appeased, by the zeal which was displayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
in his cause&mdash;moved by the strain of reckless
bravery evinced by the challenger, with a
hardihood akin to his own&mdash;perhaps also not unwilling
to display, in the view of his <i>cour plénière</i>,
more temperance than he had been at first capable
of. "Hold, I command you all.&mdash;Toison d'Or,
gather up these gauntlets, and return them each to
his owner. God and St. George forbid that we
should hazard the life of even the least of our
noble Burgundian gentry against such a churl as
this Swiss peasant, who never so much as mounted
a horse, and knows not a jot of knightly courtesy,
or the grace of chivalry.&mdash;Carry your vulgar
brawls elsewhere, young man, and know that, on
the present occasion, the Place Morimont were your
only fitting lists, and the hangman your meet
antagonist. And you, sirs, his companions&mdash;whose
behaviour in suffering this swaggerer to
take the lead amongst you seems to show that the
laws of nature, as well as of society, are inverted,
and that youth is preferred to age, as gentry to
peasants&mdash;you white-bearded men, I say, is there
none of you who can speak your errand in such
language as it becomes a sovereign prince to listen
to?"</p>

<p>"God forbid else," said the Landamman, stepping
forward and silencing Rudolph Donnerhugel,
who was commencing an answer of defiance&mdash;"God
forbid," he said, "noble Duke, that we
should not be able to speak so as to be understood
before your Highness, since, I trust, we shall
speak the language of truth, peace, and justice.
Nay, should it incline your Highness to listen to
us the more favourably for our humility, I am
willing to humble myself rather than you should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
shun to hear us. For my own part, I can truly
say that, though I have lived, and by free choice
have resolved to die, a husbandman and a hunter
on the Alps of the Unterwald, I may claim by
birth the hereditary right to speak before Dukes
and Kings, and the Emperor himself. There is
no one, my Lord Duke, in this proud assembly,
who derives his descent from a nobler source than
Geierstein."</p>

<p>"We have heard of you," said the Duke.
"Men call you the peasant-count. Your birth is
your shame; or perhaps your mother's, if your
father had happened to have a handsome ploughman,
the fitting father of one who has become a
willing serf."</p>

<p>"No serf, my lord," answered the Landamman,
"but a freeman, who will neither oppress others
nor be himself tyrannised over. My father was
a noble lord, my mother a most virtuous lady.
But I will not be provoked, by taunt or scornful
jest, to refrain from stating with calmness what
my country has given me in charge to say. The
inhabitants of the bleak and inhospitable regions
of the Alps desire, mighty sir, to remain at peace
with all their neighbours, and to enjoy the government
they have chosen, as best fitted to their
condition and habits, leaving all other states and
countries to their free-will in the same respects.
Especially, they desire to remain at peace and in
unity with the princely House of Burgundy, whose
dominions approach their possessions on so many
points. My lord, they desire it, they entreat it,
they even consent to pray for it. We have been
termed stubborn, intractable, and insolent contemners
of authority, and headers of sedition and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
rebellion. In evidence of the contrary, my Lord
Duke, I, who never bent a knee but to Heaven,
feel no dishonour in kneeling before your Highness,
as before a sovereign prince in the <i>cour
plénière</i> of his dominions, where he has a right to
exact homage from his subjects out of duty, and
from strangers out of courtesy. No vain pride of
mine," said the noble old man, his eyes swelling
with tears, as he knelt on one knee, "shall prevent
me from personal humiliation, when peace&mdash;that
blessed peace, so dear to God, so inappreciably
valuable to man&mdash;is in danger of being broken
off."</p>

<p>The whole assembly, even the Duke himself,
were affected by the noble and stately manner in
which the brave old man made a genuflection,
which was obviously dictated by neither meanness
nor timidity. "Arise, sir," said Charles; "if we
have said aught which can wound your private
feelings, we retract it as publicly as the reproach
was spoken, and sit prepared to hear you, as a
fair-meaning envoy."</p>

<p>"For that, my noble lord, thanks; and I shall
hold it a blessed day, if I can find words worthy
of the cause I have to plead. My lord, a schedule
in your Highness's hands has stated the sense of
many injuries received at the hand of your Highness's
officers, and those of Romont, Count of
Savoy, your strict ally and adviser, we have a
right to suppose, under your Highness's countenance.
For Count Romont&mdash;he has already felt
with whom he has to contend; but we have as
yet taken no measures to avenge injuries, affronts,
interruptions to our commerce, from those
who have availed themselves of your Highness's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
authority to intercept our countrymen, spoil our
goods, impress their persons, and even, in some
instances, take their lives. The affray at La
Ferette&mdash;I can vouch for what I saw&mdash;had no
origin or abettance from us; nevertheless, it is
impossible an independent nation can suffer the
repetition of such injuries, and free and independent
we are determined to remain, or to die in
defence of our rights. What then must follow,
unless your Highness listens to the terms which
I am commissioned to offer? War, a war to extermination;
for so long as one of our Confederacy
can wield a halberd, so long, if this fatal strife
once commences, there will be war betwixt your
powerful realms and our poor and barren States.
And what can the noble Duke of Burgundy gain
by such a strife? Is it wealth and plunder?
Alas, my lord, there is more gold and silver on
the very bridle-bits of your Highness's household
troops than can be found in the public treasures or
private hoards of our whole Confederacy. Is it
fame and glory you aspire to? There is little
honour to be won by a numerous army over a
few scattered bands, by men clad in mail over
half-armed husbandmen and shepherds&mdash;of such
conquest small were the glory. But if, as all
Christian men believe, and as it is the constant
trust of my countrymen, from memory of the
times of our fathers,&mdash;if the Lord of Hosts should
cast the balance in behalf of the fewer numbers
and worse-armed party, I leave it with your Highness
to judge what would, in that event, be the
diminution of worship and fame. Is it extent of
vassalage and dominion your Highness desires, by
warring with your mountain neighbours? Know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
that you may, if it be God's will, gain our barren
and rugged mountains; but, like our ancestors
of old, we will seek refuge in wilder and more
distant solitudes, and, when we have resisted to
the last, we will starve in the icy wastes of the
glaciers. Ay, men, women, and children, we will
be frozen into annihilation together, ere one free
Switzer will acknowledge a foreign master."</p>

<p>The speech of the Landamman made an obvious
impression on the assembly. The Duke observed
it, and his hereditary obstinacy was irritated by
the general disposition which he saw entertained
in favour of the ambassador. This evil principle
overcame some impression which the address of
the noble Biederman had not failed to make upon
him. He answered with a lowering brow, interrupting
the old man as he was about to continue
his speech,&mdash;"You argue falsely, Sir Count, or
Sir Landamman, or by whatever name you call
yourself, if you think we war on you from any
hope of spoil, or any desire of glory. We know as
well as you can tell us that there is neither profit
nor fame to be achieved by conquering you. But
sovereigns, to whom Heaven has given the power,
must root out a band of robbers, though there is
dishonour in measuring swords with them; and
we hunt to death a herd of wolves, though their
flesh is carrion, and their skins are naught."</p>

<p>The Landamman shook his grey head, and replied,
without testifying emotion, and even with
something approaching to a smile,&mdash;"I am an
older woodsman than you, my Lord Duke&mdash;and,
it may be, a more experienced one. The boldest,
the hardiest hunter, will not safely drive the wolf
to his den. I have shown your Highness the poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
chance of gain, and the great risk of loss, which
even you, powerful as you are, must incur by
risking a war with determined and desperate men.
Let me now tell what we are willing to do to
secure a sincere and lasting peace with our powerful
neighbour of Burgundy. Your Grace is in the
act of engrossing Lorraine, and it seems probable,
under so vigorous and enterprising a Prince, your
authority may be extended to the shores of the
Mediterranean&mdash;be our noble friend and sincere
ally, and our mountains, defended by warriors
familiar with victory, will be your barriers against
Germany and Italy. For your sake we will admit
the Count of Savoy to terms, and restore to him
our conquests, on such conditions as your Highness
shall yourself judge reasonable. Of past subjects
of offence on the part of your lieutenants and
governors upon the frontier we will be silent, so
we have assurance of no such aggressions in future.
Nay, more, and it is my last and proudest offer,
we will send three thousand of our youth to assist
your Highness in any war which you may engage
in, whether against Louis of France or the Emperor
of Germany. They are a different set of men&mdash;proudly
and truly may I state it&mdash;from the scum
of Germany and Italy, who form themselves into
mercenary bands of soldiers. And, if Heaven
should decide your Highness to accept our offer,
there will be one corps in your army which will
leave their carcasses on the field ere a man of them
break their plighted troth."</p>

<p>A swarthy but tall and handsome man, wearing
a corselet richly engraved with arabesque work,
started from his seat with the air of one provoked
beyond the bounds of restraint. This was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Count de Campo-basso, commander of Charles's
Italian mercenaries, who possessed, as has been
alluded to, much influence over the Duke's mind,
chiefly obtained by accommodating himself to his
master's opinions and prejudices, and placing before
the Duke specious arguments to justify him
for following his own way.</p>

<p>"This lofty presence must excuse me," he said,
"if I speak in defence of my honour, and those of
my bold lances, who have followed my fortunes
from Italy to serve the bravest Prince in Christendom.
I might, indeed, pass over without
resentment the outrageous language of this grey-haired
churl, whose words cannot affect a knight
and a nobleman more than the yelling of a peasant's
mastiff. But when I hear him propose to
associate his bands of mutinous misgoverned ruffians
with your Highness's troops, I must let him
know that there is not a horse-boy in my ranks
who would fight in such fellowship. No, even I
myself, bound by a thousand ties of gratitude,
could not submit to strive abreast with such
comrades. I would fold up my banners, and lead
five thousand men to seek,&mdash;not a nobler master,
for the world has none such,&mdash;but wars in
which we might not be obliged to blush for our
assistants."</p>

<p>"Silence, Campo-basso!" said the Duke, "and
be assured you serve a prince who knows your
worth too well to exchange it for the untried and
untrustful services of those whom we have only
known as vexatious and malignant neighbours."</p>

<p>Then, addressing himself to Arnold Biederman,
he said coldly and sternly, "Sir Landamman, we
have heard you fairly. We have heard you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
although you come before us with hands dyed deep
in the blood of our servant, Sir Archibald de
Hagenbach; for, supposing he was murdered by a
villanous association,&mdash;which, by St. George! shall
never, while we live and reign, raise its pestilential
head on this side of the Rhine,&mdash;yet it is not
the less undeniable and undenied, that you stood
by in arms, and encouraged the deed the assassins
performed under your countenance. Return to
your mountains, and be thankful that you return
in life. Tell those who sent you that I will be
presently on their frontiers. A deputation of your
most notable persons, who meet me with halters
round their necks, torches in their left hands, in
their right their swords held by the point, may
learn on what conditions we will grant you
peace."</p>

<p>"Then farewell peace, and welcome war," said
the Landamman; "and be its plagues and curses
on the heads of those who choose blood and strife
rather than peace and union. We will meet you
on our frontiers with our naked swords, but the
hilts, not their points, shall be in our grasp.
Charles of Burgundy, Flanders, and Lorraine,
Duke of seven dukedoms, Count of seventeen earldoms,
I bid you defiance; and declare war against
you in the name of the confederated Cantons, and
such others as shall adhere to them. There," he
said, "are my letters of defiance."</p>

<p>The herald took from Arnold Biederman the
fatal denunciation.</p>

<p>"Read it not, Toison d'Or!" said the haughty
Duke. "Let the executioner drag it through the
streets at his horse's tail, and nail it to the gibbet,
to show in what account we hold the paltry scroll,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
and those who sent it.&mdash;Away, sirs!" speaking
to the Swiss. "Trudge back to your wildernesses
with such haste as your feet can use. When we
next meet, you shall better know whom you have
offended.&mdash;Get our horse ready&mdash;the council is
broken up."</p>

<p>The Maire of Dijon, when all were in motion to
leave the hall, again approached the Duke, and
timidly expressed some hopes that his Highness
would deign to partake of a banquet which the
magistracy had prepared, in expectation he might
do them such an honour.</p>

<p>"No, by St. George of Burgundy, Sir Maire,"
said Charles, with one of the withering glances by
which he was wont to express indignation mixed
with contempt,&mdash;"you have not pleased us so
well with our breakfast as to induce us to trust
our dinner to the loyalty of our good town of
Dijon."</p>

<p>So saying, he rudely turned off from the mortified
chief magistrate, and, mounting his horse,
rode back to his camp, conversing earnestly on
the way with the Count of Campo-basso.</p>

<p>"I would offer you dinner, my Lord of Oxford,"
said Colvin to that nobleman, when he alighted at
his tent, "but I foresee, ere you could swallow a
mouthful, you will be summoned to the Duke's
presence; for it is our Charles's way, when he has
fixed on a wrong course, to wrangle with his
friends and counsellors, in order to prove it is a
right one. Marry, he always makes a convert of
yon supple Italian."</p>

<p>Colvin's augury was speedily realised; for a
page almost immediately summoned the English
merchant, Philipson, to attend the Duke. Without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
waiting an instant, Charles poured forth an
incoherent tide of reproaches against the Estates of
his dukedom, for refusing him their countenance
in so slight a matter, and launched out in explanations
of the necessity which he alleged there was
for punishing the audacity of the Swiss. "And
thou too, Oxford," he concluded, "art such an impatient
fool as to wish me to engage in a distant
war with England, and transport forces over the
sea, when I have such insolent mutineers to chastise
on my own frontiers?"</p>

<p>When he was at length silent, the English Earl
laid before him, with respectful earnestness, the
danger that appeared to be involved in engaging
with a people, poor indeed, but universally dreaded,
from their discipline and courage, and that under
the eye of so dangerous a rival as Louis of France,
who was sure to support the Duke's enemies underhand,
if he did not join them openly. On this
point the Duke's resolution was immovable. "It
shall never," he said, "be told of me, that I
uttered threats which I dared not execute. These
boors have declared war against me, and they
shall learn whose wrath it is that they have wantonly
provoked; but I do not, therefore, renounce
thy scheme, my good Oxford. If thou canst procure
me this same cession of Provence, and induce
old René to give up the cause of his grandson,
Ferrand of Vaudemont, in Lorraine, thou wilt
make it well worth my while to send thee brave
aid against my brother Blackburn, who, while he
is drinking healths pottle-deep in France, may
well come to lose his lands in England. And be
not impatient because I cannot at this very instant
send men across the seas. The march which I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
making towards Neufchatel, which is, I think,
the nearest point where I shall find these churls,
will be but like a morning's excursion. I trust
you will go with us, old companion. I should
like to see if you have forgotten, among yonder
mountains, how to back a horse and lay a lance
in rest."</p>

<p>"I will wait on your Highness," said the Earl,
"as is my duty, for my motions must depend on
your pleasure. But I will not carry arms, especially
against those people of Helvetia, from whom
I have experienced hospitality, unless it be for my
own personal defence."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the Duke, "e'en be it so; we
shall have in you an excellent judge, to tell us
who best discharges his devoir against the mountain
clowns."</p>

<p>At this point in the conversation there was a
knocking at the entrance of the pavilion, and the
Chancellor of Burgundy presently entered, in great
haste and anxiety. "News, my lord&mdash;news of
France and England," said the prelate, and then,
observing the presence of a stranger, he looked at
the Duke, and was silent.</p>

<p>"It is a faithful friend, my Lord Bishop," said
the Duke; "you may tell your news before him."</p>

<p>"It will soon be generally known," said the
chancellor. "Louis and Edward are fully accorded."
Both the Duke and the English Earl
started.</p>

<p>"I expected this," said the Duke, "but not so
soon."</p>

<p>"The Kings have met," answered his minister.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;in battle?" said Oxford, forgetting
himself in his extreme eagerness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>The chancellor was somewhat surprised, but as
the Duke seemed to expect him to give an answer,
he replied, "No, Sir Stranger&mdash;not in battle, but
upon appointment, and in peace and amity."</p>

<p>"The sight must have been worth seeing," said
the Duke; "when the old fox Louis, and my
brother Black&mdash;I mean my brother Edward&mdash;met.
Where held they their rendezvous?"</p>

<p>"On a bridge over the Seine, at Picquigny."</p>

<p>"I would thou hadst been there," said the Duke,
looking to Oxford, "with a good axe in thy hand,
to strike one fair blow for England, and another
for Burgundy. My grandfather was treacherously
slain at just such a meeting, at the Bridge of
Montereau, upon the Yonne."</p>

<p>"To prevent a similar chance," said the chancellor,
"a strong barricade, such as closes the cages
in which men keep wild beasts, was raised in the
midst of the bridge, and prevented the possibility
of their even touching each other's hands."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! By St. George, that smells of Louis's
craft and caution; for the Englishman, to give
him his due, is as little acquainted with fear as
with policy. But what terms have they made?
Where do the English army winter? What towns,
fortresses, and castles are surrendered to them, in
pledge, or in perpetuity?"</p>

<p>"None, my liege," said the chancellor. "The
English army returns into England, as fast as
shipping can be procured to transport them; and
Louis will accommodate them with every sail and
oar in his dominions, rather than they should not
instantly evacuate France."</p>

<p>"And by what concessions has Louis bought a
peace so necessary to his affairs?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>"By fair words," said the chancellor, "by liberal
presents, and by some five hundred tuns of wine."</p>

<p>"Wine!" exclaimed the Duke. "Heardst thou
ever the like, Seignor Philipson? Why, your
countrymen are little better than Esau, who sold
his birthright for a mess of pottage. Marry, I
must confess I never saw an Englishman who
loved a dry-lipped bargain."</p>

<p>"I can scarce believe this news," said the Earl
of Oxford. "If this Edward were content to cross
the sea with fifty thousand Englishmen merely to
return again, there are in his camp both proud
nobles and haughty commons enough to resist his
disgraceful purpose."</p>

<p>"The money of Louis," said the statesman, "has
found noble hands willing to clutch it. The wine
of France has flooded every throat in the English
army&mdash;the riot and uproar was unbounded&mdash;and
at one time the town of Amiens, where Louis
himself resided, was full of so many English
archers, all of them intoxicated, that the person of
the King of France was almost in their hands.
Their sense of national honour has been lost in
the universal revel, and those amongst them who
would be more dignified and play the wise politicians
say, that having come to France by connivance
of the Duke of Burgundy, and that prince
having failed to join them with his forces, they
have done well, wisely, and gallantly, considering
the season of the year, and the impossibility of
obtaining quarters, to take tribute of France, and
return home in triumph."</p>

<p>"And leave Louis," said Oxford, "at undisturbed
freedom to attack Burgundy with all his
forces?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>"Not so, friend Philipson," said Duke Charles;
"know, that there is a truce betwixt Burgundy
and France for the space of seven years, and had
not this been granted and signed, it is probable
that we might have found some means of marring
the treaty betwixt Edward and Louis, even at the
expense of affording those voracious islanders beef
and beer during the winter months.&mdash;Sir Chancellor,
you may leave us, but be within reach of a
hasty summons."</p>

<p>When his minister left the pavilion, the Duke,
who with his rude and imperious character united
much kindness, if it could not be termed generosity
of disposition, came up to the Lancastrian
lord, who stood like one at whose feet a thunderbolt
has just broken, and who is still appalled by
the terrors of the shock.</p>

<p>"My poor Oxford," he said, "thou art stupefied
by this news, which thou canst not doubt must
have a fatal effect on the plan which thy brave
bosom cherishes with such devoted fidelity. I
would for thy sake I could have detained the English
a little longer in France; but had I attempted
to do so, there were an end of my truce with Louis,
and of course to my power to chastise these paltry
Cantons, or send forth an expedition to England.
As matters stand, give me but a week to punish
these mountaineers, and you shall have a larger
force than your modesty has requested of me for
your enterprise; and, in the meanwhile, I will
take care that Blackburn and his cousin-archers
have no assistance of shipping from Flanders.
Tush, man, never fear it&mdash;thou wilt be in England
long ere they; and, once more, rely on my
assistance&mdash;always, thou knowest, the cession of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
Provence being executed, as in reason. Our cousin
Margaret's diamonds we must keep for a time;
and perhaps they may pass as a pledge, with some
of our own, for the godly purpose of setting at
freedom the imprisoned angels of our Flemish
usurers, who will not lend even to their sovereign,
unless on good current security. To such straits
has the disobedient avarice of our Estates for the
moment reduced us."</p>

<p>"Alas! my lord," said the dejected nobleman,
"I were ungrateful to doubt the sincerity of your
good intentions. But who can presume on the
events of war, especially when time presses for
instant decision? You are pleased to trust me.
Let your Highness extend your confidence thus
far: I will take my horse, and ride after the Landamman,
if he hath already set forth. I have
little doubt to make such an accommodation with
him that you may be secure on all your south-eastern
frontiers. You may then with security
work your will in Lorraine and Provence."</p>

<p>"Do not speak of it," said the Duke, sharply;
"thou forget'st thyself and me, when thou supposest
that a prince, who has pledged his word to
his people, can recall it like a merchant chaffering
for his paltry wares. Go to&mdash;we will assist you,
but we will be ourselves judge of the time and
manner. Yet, having both kind will to our distressed
cousin of Anjou, and being your good
friend, we will not linger in the matter. Our
host have orders to break up this evening and
direct their march against Neufchatel, where these
proud Swiss shall have a taste of the fire and
sword which they have provoked."</p>

<p>Oxford sighed deeply, but made no further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
remonstrance; in which he acted wisely, since it
was likely to have exasperated the fiery temper
of the sovereign to whom it was addressed, while
it was certain that it would not in the slightest
degree alter his resolution.</p>

<p>He took farewell of the Duke, and returned to
Colvin, whom he found immersed in the business
of his department, and preparing for the removal
of the artillery&mdash;an operation which the clumsiness
of the ordnance, and the execrable state of
the roads, rendered at that time a much more
troublesome operation than at present, though it
is even still one of the most laborious movements
attending the march of an army. The Master of
the Ordnance welcomed Oxford with much glee,
and congratulated himself on the distinguished
honour of enjoying his company during the campaign,
and acquainted him that, by the especial
command of the Duke, he had made fitting preparations
for his accommodation, suitable to the
disguised character which he meant to maintain,
but in every other respect as convenient as a camp
could admit of.

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>A mirthful man he was&mdash;the snows of age</p>
<p>Fell, but they did not chill him. Gaiety,</p>
<p>Even in life's closing, touch'd his teeming brain</p>
<p>With such wild visions as the setting sun</p>
<p>Raises in front of some hoar glacier,</p>
<p>Painting the bleak ice with a thousand hues.</p>

<p class="i12"><i>Old Play.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>Leaving the Earl of Oxford in attendance on the
stubborn Duke of Burgundy during an expedition
which the one represented as a brief excursion,
more resembling a hunting-party than a campaign,
and which the other considered in a much graver
and more perilous light, we return to Arthur de
Vere, or the younger Philipson, as he continued to
be called, who was conducted by his guide with
fidelity and success, but certainly very slowly,
upon his journey into Provence.</p>

<p>The state of Lorraine, overrun by the Duke of
Burgundy's army, and infested at the same time
by different scattered bands, who took the field,
or held out the castles, as they alleged, for the
interest of Count Ferrand de Vaudemont, rendered
journeying so dangerous, that it was often necessary
to leave the main road, and to take circuitous
tracks, in order to avoid such unfriendly encounters
as travellers might otherwise have met with.</p>

<p>Arthur, taught by sad experience to distrust
strange guides, found himself, nevertheless, in
this eventful and perilous journey, disposed to rest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
considerable confidence in his present conductor,
Thiebault, a Provençal by birth, intimately acquainted
with the roads which they took, and, as
far as he could judge, disposed to discharge his
office with fidelity. Prudence alike, and the
habits which he had acquired in travelling, as
well as the character of a merchant which he still
sustained, induced him to wave the <i>morgue</i>, or
haughty superiority of a knight and noble towards
an inferior personage, especially as he rightly
conjectured that free intercourse with this man,
whose acquirements seemed of a superior cast,
was likely to render him a judge of his opinions
and disposition towards him. In return for his
condescension, he obtained a good deal of information
concerning the province which he was
approaching.</p>

<p>As they drew near the boundaries of Provence,
the communications of Thiebault became more
fluent and interesting. He could not only tell the
name and history of each romantic castle which
they passed, in their devious and doubtful route,
but had at his command the chivalrous history of
the noble knights and barons to whom they now
pertained, or had belonged in earlier days, and
could recount their exploits against the Saracens,
by repelling their attacks upon Christendom, or
their efforts to recover the Holy Sepulchre from
Pagan hands. In the course of such narrations,
Thiebault was led to speak of the Troubadours, a
race of native poets of Provençal origin, differing
widely from the minstrels of Normandy, and the
adjacent provinces of France, with whose tales of
chivalry, as well as the numerous translations of
their works into Norman-French and English,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Arthur, like most of the noble youth of his country,
was intimately acquainted and deeply imbued.
Thiebault boasted that his grandsire, of humble
birth indeed, but of distinguished talent, was one
of this gifted race, whose compositions produced
so great an effect on the temper and manners of
their age and country. It was, however, to be
regretted that, inculcating as the prime duty of
life a fantastic spirit of gallantry, which sometimes
crossed the Platonic bound prescribed to it,
the poetry of the Troubadours was too frequently
used to soften and seduce the heart, and corrupt
the principles.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
</p>

<p>Arthur's attention was called to this peculiarity
by Thiebault singing, which he could do with
good skill, the history of a Troubadour, named
William Cabestainy, who loved, <i>par amours</i>, a
noble and beautiful lady, Margaret, the wife of a
baron called Raymond de Roussillon. The jealous
husband obtained proof of his dishonour, and,
having put Cabestainy to death by assassination,
he took his heart from his bosom, and causing it
to be dressed like that of an animal, ordered it to
be served up to his lady; and when she had eaten
of the horrible mess, told her of what her banquet
was composed. The lady replied, that since she
had been made to partake of food so precious, no
coarser morsel should ever after cross her lips.
She persisted in her resolution, and thus starved
herself to death. The Troubadour who celebrated
this tragic history had displayed in his composition
a good deal of poetic art. Glossing over the
error of the lovers as the fault of their destiny,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
dwelling on their tragical fate with considerable
pathos, and, finally, execrating the blind fury of
the husband, with the full fervour of poetical indignation,
he recorded, with vindictive pleasure,
how every bold knight and true lover in the south
of France assembled to besiege the baron's castle,
stormed it by main force, left not one stone upon
another, and put the tyrant himself to an ignominious
death. Arthur was interested in the melancholy
tale, which even beguiled him of a few
tears; but as he thought further on its purport, he
dried his eyes, and said, with some sternness,&mdash;"Thiebault,
sing me no more such lays. I have
heard my father say that the readiest mode to
corrupt a Christian man is to bestow upon vice the
pity and the praise which are due only to virtue.
Your Baron of Roussillon is a monster of cruelty;
but your unfortunate lovers were not the less
guilty. It is by giving fair names to foul actions
that those who would start at real vice are led to
practise its lessons, under the disguise of virtue."</p>

<p>"I would you knew, Seignor," answered Thiebault,
"that this Lay of Cabestainy and the Lady
Margaret of Roussillon is reckoned a masterpiece of
the joyous science. Fie, sir, you are too young to
be so strict a censor of morals. What will you do
when your head is grey, if you are thus severe
when it is scarcely brown?"</p>

<p>"A head which listens to folly in youth will
hardly be honourable in old age," answered
Arthur.</p>

<p>Thiebault had no mind to carry the dispute
further.</p>

<p>"It is not for me to contend with your worship.
I only think, with every true son of chivalry and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
song, that a knight without a mistress is like a
sky without a star."</p>

<p>"Do I not know that?" answered Arthur; "but
yet better remain in darkness than be guided by
such false lights as shower down vice and
pestilence."</p>

<p>"Nay, it may be your seignorie is right,"
answered the guide. "It is certain that even in
Provence here we have lost much of our keen judgment
on matters of love&mdash;its difficulties, its intricacies,
and its errors, since the Troubadours are no
longer regarded as usual, and since the High and
Noble Parliament of Love<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
 has ceased to hold its
sittings.</p>

<p>"But in these latter days," continued the Provençal,
"kings, dukes, and sovereigns, instead of
being the foremost and most faithful vassals of
the Court of Cupid, are themselves the slaves
of selfishness and love of gain. Instead of winning
hearts by breaking lances in the lists, they
are breaking the hearts of their impoverished
vassals by the most cruel exactions&mdash;instead
of attempting to deserve the smile and favours of
their lady-loves, they are meditating how to steal
castles, towns, and provinces from their neighbours.
But long life to the good and venerable
King René! While he has an acre of land left,
his residence will be the resort of valiant knights,
whose only aim is praise in arms, of true lovers,
who are persecuted by fortune, and of high-toned
harpers, who know how to celebrate faith and
valour."</p>

<p>Arthur, interested in learning something more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
precise than common fame had taught him on the
subject of this prince, easily induced the talkative
Provençal to enlarge upon the virtues of his old
sovereign's character, as just, joyous, and debonair,
a friend to the most noble exercises of the chase
and the tilt-yard, and still more so to the joyous
science of Poetry and Music; who gave away more
revenue than he received, in largesses to knights-errant
and itinerant musicians, with whom his
petty court was crowded, as one of the very few
in which the ancient hospitality was still maintained.</p>

<p>Such was the picture which Thiebault drew of
the last minstrel monarch; and though the eulogium
was exaggerated, perhaps the facts were not
overcharged.</p>

<p>Born of royal parentage, and with high pretensions,
René had at no period of his life been able
to match his fortunes to his claims. Of the kingdoms
to which he asserted right, nothing remained
in his possession but the county of Provence itself,
a fair and friendly principality, but diminished by
the many claims which France had acquired upon
portions of it by advances of money to supply the
personal expenses of its master, and by other portions,
which Burgundy, to whom René had been a
prisoner, held in pledge for his ransom. In his
youth he engaged in more than one military enterprise,
in the hope of attaining some part of the
territory of which he was styled sovereign. His
courage is not impeached, but fortune did not
smile on his military adventures; and he seems at
last to have become sensible that the power of
admiring and celebrating warlike merit is very
different from possessing that quality. In fact,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
René was a prince of very moderate parts, endowed
with a love of the fine arts, which he carried to
extremity, and a degree of good-humour, which
never permitted him to repine at fortune, but
rendered its possessor happy, when a prince of
keener feelings would have died of despair. This
insouciant, light-tempered, gay, and thoughtless
disposition conducted René, free from all the passions
which embitter life, and often shorten it, to
a hale and mirthful old age. Even domestic losses,
which often affect those who are proof against mere
reverses of fortune, made no deep impression on
the feelings of this cheerful old monarch. Most
of his children had died young; René took it not
to heart. His daughter Margaret's marriage with
the powerful Henry of England was considered a
connection much above the fortunes of the King
of the Troubadours. But in the issue, instead of
René deriving any splendour from the match, he
was involved in the misfortunes of his daughter,
and repeatedly obliged to impoverish himself to
supply her ransom. Perhaps in his private soul
the old king did not think these losses so mortifying
as the necessity of receiving Margaret into
his court and family. On fire when reflecting on
the losses she had sustained, mourning over friends
slain and kingdoms lost, the proudest and most
passionate of princesses was ill suited to dwell
with the gayest and best-humoured of sovereigns,
whose pursuits she contemned, and whose lightness
of temper, for finding comfort in such trifles,
she could not forgive. The discomfort attached to
her presence and vindictive recollections embarrassed
the good-humoured old monarch, though it
was unable to drive him beyond his equanimity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<p>Another distress pressed him more sorely.&mdash;Yolande,
a daughter of his first wife, Isabella, had
succeeded to his claims upon the Duchy of Lorraine,
and transmitted them to her son, Ferrand,
Count of Vaudemont, a young man of courage and
spirit, engaged at this time in the apparently desperate
undertaking of making his title good against
the Duke of Burgundy, who, with little right but
great power, was seizing upon and overrunning
this rich Duchy, which he laid claim to as a male
fief. And to conclude, while the aged king on
one side beheld his dethroned daughter in hopeless
despair, and on the other his disinherited
grandson in vain attempting to recover part of
their rights, he had the additional misfortune to
know that his nephew, Louis of France, and his
cousin, the Duke of Burgundy, were secretly contending
which should succeed him in that portion
of Provence which he still continued to possess,
and that it was only jealousy of each other which
prevented his being despoiled of this last remnant
of his territory. Yet amid all this distress René
feasted and received guests, danced, sang, composed
poetry, used the pencil or brush with no
small skill, devised and conducted festivals and
processions, and, studying to promote as far as
possible the immediate mirth and good-humour of
his subjects, if he could not materially enlarge
their more permanent prosperity, was never mentioned
by them, excepting as <i>Le bon Roi René</i>, a
distinction conferred on him down to the present
day, and due to him certainly by the qualities of
his heart, if not by those of his head.</p>

<p>Whilst Arthur was receiving from his guide a
full account of the peculiarities of King René,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
they entered the territories of that merry monarch.
It was late in the autumn, and about the period
when the south-eastern counties of France rather
show to least advantage. The foliage of the olive-tree
is then decayed and withered, and as it predominates
in the landscape, and resembles the
scorched complexion of the soil itself, an ashen
and arid hue is given to the whole. Still, however,
there were scenes in the hilly and pastoral
parts of the country where the quantity of evergreens
relieved the eye even in this dead season.</p>

<p>The appearance of the country, in general, had
much in it that was peculiar.</p>

<p>The travellers perceived at every turn some
marks of the King's singular character. Provence,
as the part of Gaul which first received Roman
civilisation, and as having been still longer the
residence of the Grecian colony who founded Marseilles,
is more full of the splendid relics of ancient
architecture than any other country in Europe,
Italy and Greece excepted. The good taste of the
King René had dictated some attempts to clear out
and to restore these memorials of antiquity. Was
there a triumphal arch or an ancient temple&mdash;huts
and hovels were cleared away from its vicinity,
and means were used at least to retard the
approach of ruin. Was there a marble fountain,
which superstition had dedicated to some sequestered
naiad&mdash;it was surrounded by olives, almond
and orange trees&mdash;its cistern was repaired, and
taught once more to retain its crystal treasures.
The huge amphitheatres and gigantic colonnades
experienced the same anxious care, attesting that
the noblest specimens of the fine arts found one
admirer and preserver in King René, even during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
the course of those which are termed the dark and
barbarous ages.</p>

<p>A change of manners could also be observed in
passing from Burgundy and Lorraine, where society
relished of German bluntness, into the pastoral
country of Provence, where the influence of a fine
climate and melodious language, joined to the pursuits
of the romantic old monarch, with the universal
taste for music and poetry, had introduced a
civilisation of manners which approached to affectation.
The shepherd literally marched abroad in
the morning, piping his flocks forth to the pasture
with some love-sonnet, the composition of an
amorous Troubadour; and his "fleecy care" seemed
actually to be under the influence of his music,
instead of being ungraciously insensible to its
melody, as is the case in colder climates. Arthur
observed, too, that the Provençal sheep, instead of
being driven before the shepherd, regularly followed
him, and did not disperse to feed until the
swain, by turning his face round to them, remaining
stationary, and, executing variations on the
air which he was playing, seemed to remind them
that it was proper to do so. While in motion, his
huge dog, of a species which is trained to face the
wolf, and who is respected by the sheep as their
guardian, and not feared as their tyrant, followed
his master with his ears pricked, like the chief
critic and prime judge of the performance, at some
tones of which he seldom failed to intimate disapprobation;
while the flock, like the generality of
an audience, followed in unanimous though silent
applause. At the hour of noon, the shepherd
had sometimes acquired an augmentation to his
audience, in some comely matron or blooming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
maiden, with whom he had rendezvoused by such a
fountain as we have described, and who listened
to the husband's or lover's chalumeau, or mingled
her voice with his in the duets, of which the songs
of the Troubadours have left so many examples.
In the cool of the evening, the dance on the
village green, or the concert before the hamlet
door; the little repast of fruits, cheese, and bread,
which the traveller was readily invited to share,
gave new charms to the illusion, and seemed in
earnest to point out Provence as the Arcadia of
France.</p>

<p>But the greatest singularity was, in the eyes of
Arthur, the total absence of armed men and soldiers
in this peaceful country. In England, no man
stirred without his long-bow, sword, and buckler.
In France, the hind wore armour even when he
was betwixt the stilts of his plough. In Germany,
you could not look along a mile of highway
but the eye was encountered by clouds of dust, out
of which were seen, by fits, waving feathers and
flashing armour. Even in Switzerland, the peasant,
if he had a journey to make, though but of a
mile or two, cared not to travel without his halberd
and two-handed sword. But in Provence all
seemed quiet and peaceful, as if the music of the
land had lulled to sleep all its wrathful passions.
Now and then a mounted cavalier might pass
them, the harp at whose saddle-bow, or carried by
one of his attendants, attested the character of a
Troubadour, which was affected by men of all
ranks; and then only a short sword on his left
thigh, borne for show rather than use, was a necessary
and appropriate part of his equipment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<p>"Peace," said Arthur, as he looked around him,
"is an inestimable jewel; but it will be soon
snatched from those who are not prepared with
heart and hand to defend it."</p>

<p>The sight of the ancient and interesting town of
Aix, where King René held his court, dispelled
reflections of a general character, and recalled to
the young Englishman the peculiar mission on
which he was engaged.</p>

<p>He then required to know from the Provençal
Thiebault whether his instructions were to leave
him, now that he had successfully attained the
end of his journey.</p>

<p>"My instructions," answered Thiebault, "are to
remain in Aix while there is any chance of your
seignorie's continuing there, to be of such use to
you as you may require, either as a guide or an
attendant, and to keep these men in readiness to
wait upon you when you have occasion for messengers
or guards. With your approbation, I will
see them disposed of in fitting quarters, and receive
my further instructions from your seignorie
wherever you please to appoint me. I propose this
separation, because I understand it is your present
pleasure to be private."</p>

<p>"I must go to court," answered Arthur, "without
any delay. Wait for me in half an hour by
that fountain in the street, which projects into the
air such a magnificent pillar of water, surrounded,
I would almost swear, by a vapour like steam,
serving as a shroud to the jet which it envelopes."</p>

<p>"The jet is so surrounded," answered the Provençal,
"because it is supplied by a hot spring
rising from the bowels of the earth, and the touch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
of frost on this autumn morning makes the vapour
more distinguishable than usual.&mdash;But if it is
good King René whom you seek, you will find
him at this time walking in his chimney. Do not
be afraid of approaching him, for there never was
a monarch so easy of access, especially to good-looking
strangers like you, seignorie."</p>

<p>"But his ushers," said Arthur, "will not admit
me into his hall."</p>

<p>"His hall!" repeated Thiebault. "Whose
hall?"</p>

<p>"Why, King René's, I apprehend. If he is
walking in a chimney, it can only be in that of
his hall, and a stately one it must be to give him
room for such exercise."</p>

<p>"You mistake my meaning," said the guide,
laughing. "What we call King René's chimney
is the narrow parapet yonder; it extends between
these two towers, has an exposure to the south,
and is sheltered in every other direction. Yonder
it is his pleasure to walk and enjoy the beams of
the sun, on such cool mornings as the present.
It nurses, he says, his poetical vein. If you
approach his promenade he will readily speak to
you, unless, indeed, he is in the very act of a
poetical composition."</p>

<p>Arthur could not forbear smiling at the thoughts
of a king, eighty years of age, broken down with
misfortunes and beset with dangers, who yet
amused himself with walking in an open parapet,
and composing poetry in presence of all such of his
loving subjects as chose to look on.</p>

<p>"If you will walk a few steps this way," said
Thiebault, "you may see the good King, and judge
whether or not you will accost him at present. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
will dispose of the people, and await your orders
at the fountain in the Corso."</p>

<p>Arthur saw no objection to the proposal of his
guide, and was not unwilling to have an opportunity
of seeing something of the good King René,
before he was introduced to his presence.

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Ay, this is he who wears the wreath of bays</p>
<p>Wove by Apollo and the Sisters Nine,</p>
<p>Which Jove's dread lightning scathes not. He hath doft</p>
<p>The cumbrous helm of steel, and flung aside</p>
<p>The yet more galling diadem of gold;</p>
<p>While, with a leafy circlet round his brows,</p>
<p>He reigns the King of Lovers and of Poets.</p>
</div></div>

<p>A cautious approach to the chimney&mdash;that is,
the favourite walk of the King, who is described
by Shakspeare as bearing</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i3">the style of King of Naples,</p>
<p>Of both the Sicilies, and Jerusalem,</p>
<p>Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman,</p>
</div></div>

<p>gave Arthur the perfect survey of his Majesty in
person. He saw an old man, with locks and
beard, which, in amplitude and whiteness, nearly
rivalled those of the envoy from Schwitz, but with
a fresh and ruddy colour in his cheek, and an eye
of great vivacity. His dress was showy to a
degree almost inconsistent with his years; and
his step, not only firm but full of alertness and
vivacity, while occupied in traversing the short
and sheltered walk, which he had chosen rather
for comfort than for privacy, showed juvenile
vigour still animating an aged frame. The old
King carried his tablets and a pencil in his hand,
seeming totally abstracted in his own thoughts,
and indifferent to being observed by several persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
from the public street beneath his elevated
promenade.</p>

<p>Of these, some, from their dress and manner,
seemed themselves Troubadours; for they held in
their hands rebecks, rotes, small portable harps,
and other indications of their profession. Such
appeared to be stationary, as if engaged in observing
and recording their remarks on the meditations
of their Prince. Other passengers, bent on
their own more serious affairs, looked up to the
King as to some one whom they were accustomed
to see daily, but never passed without doffing their
bonnets, and expressing, by a suitable obeisance, a
respect and affection towards his person, which
appeared to make up in cordiality of feeling what
it wanted in deep and solemn deference.</p>

<p>René, in the meanwhile, was apparently unconscious
both of the gaze of such as stood still, or
the greeting of those who passed on, his mind
seeming altogether engrossed with the apparent
labour of some arduous task in poetry or music.
He walked fast or slow as best suited the progress
of composition. At times he stopped to mark
hastily down on his tablets something which
seemed to occur to him as deserving of preservation;
at other times he dashed out what he had
written, and flung down the pencil as if in a sort
of despair. On these occasions, the Sibylline leaf
was carefully picked up by a beautiful page, his
only attendant, who reverently observed the first
suitable opportunity of restoring it again to his
royal hand. The same youth bore a viol, on
which, at a signal from his master, he occasionally
struck a few musical notes, to which the old King
listened, now with a soothed and satisfied air, now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
with a discontented and anxious brow. At times
his enthusiasm rose so high that he even hopped
and skipped, with an activity which his years did
not promise; at other times his motions were
extremely slow, and occasionally he stood still,
like one wrapped in the deepest and most anxious
meditation. When he chanced to look on the
group which seemed to watch his motions, and who
ventured even to salute him with a murmur of
applause, it was only to distinguish them with a
friendly and good-humoured nod; a salutation
with which, likewise, he failed not to reply to the
greeting of the occasional passengers, when his
earnest attention to his task, whatever it might
be, permitted him to observe them.</p>

<p>At length the royal eye lighted upon Arthur,
whose attitude of silent observation and the distinction
of his figure pointed him out as a stranger.
René beckoned to his page, who, receiving his
master's commands in a whisper, descended from
the royal chimney to the broader platform beneath,
which was open to general resort. The youth,
addressing Arthur with much courtesy, informed
him the King desired to speak with him. The
young Englishman had no alternative but that of
approaching, though pondering much in his own
mind how he ought to comport himself towards
such a singular specimen of royalty.</p>

<p>When he drew near, King René addressed him in
a tone of courtesy not unmingled with dignity, and
Arthur's awe in his immediate presence was greater
than he himself could have anticipated from his
previous conception of the royal character.</p>

<p>"You are, from your appearance, fair sir," said
King René, "a stranger in this country. By what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
name must we call you, and to what business are
we to ascribe the happiness of seeing you at our
court?"</p>

<p>Arthur remained a moment silent, and the good
old man, imputing it to awe and timidity, proceeded
in an encouraging tone.</p>

<p>"Modesty in youth is ever commendable; you
are doubtless an acolyte in the noble and joyous
science of Minstrelsy and Music, drawn hither
by the willing welcome which we afford to the
professors of those arts, in which&mdash;praise be to
Our Lady and the saints!&mdash;we have ourself been
deemed a proficient."</p>

<p>"I do not aspire to the honours of a Troubadour,"
answered Arthur.</p>

<p>"I believe you," answered the King, "for your
speech smacks of the northern, or Norman-French,
such as is spoken in England and other unrefined
nations. But you are a minstrel, perhaps, from
these ultramontane parts. Be assured we despise
not their efforts; for we have listened, not without
pleasure and instruction, to many of their bold
and wild romaunts, which, though rude in device
and language, and therefore far inferior to the
regulated poetry of our Troubadours, have yet
something in their powerful and rough measure
which occasionally rouses the heart like the sound
of a trumpet."</p>

<p>"I have felt the truth of your Grace's observation,
when I have heard the songs of my country,"
said Arthur; "but I have neither skill nor
audacity to imitate what I admire&mdash;My latest
residence has been in Italy."</p>

<p>"You are perhaps, then, a proficient in painting,"
said René; "an art which applies itself to the eye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
as poetry and music do to the ear, and is scarce
less in esteem with us. If you are skilful in the
art, you have come to a monarch who loves it, and
the fair country in which it is practised."</p>

<p>"In simple truth, Sire, I am an Englishman,
and my hand has been too much welk'd and
hardened by practice of the bow, the lance, and
the sword, to touch the harp, or even the pencil."</p>

<p>"An Englishman!" said René, obviously relaxing
in the warmth of his welcome. "And what
brings you here? England and I have long had
little friendship together."</p>

<p>"It is even on that account that I am here,"
said Arthur. "I come to pay my homage to your
Grace's daughter, the Princess Margaret of Anjou,
whom I and many true Englishmen regard still
as our Queen, though traitors have usurped her
title."</p>

<p>"Alas, good youth," said René, "I must grieve
for you, while I respect your loyalty and faith.
Had my daughter Margaret been of my mind, she
had long since abandoned pretensions which have
drowned in seas of blood the noblest and bravest
of her adherents."</p>

<p>The King seemed about to say more, but checked
himself.</p>

<p>"Go to my palace," he said; "inquire for the
Seneschal Hugh de Saint Cyr, he will give thee
the means of seeing Margaret&mdash;that is, if it be
her will to see thee. If not, good English youth,
return to my palace, and thou shalt have hospitable
entertainment; for a King who loves minstrelsy,
music, and painting is ever most sensible
to the claims of honour, virtue, and loyalty; and
I read in thy looks thou art possessed of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
qualities, and willingly believe thou mayst, in
more quiet times, aspire to share the honours of
the joyous science. But if thou hast a heart to be
touched by the sense of beauty and fair proportion,
it will leap within thee at the first sight of my
palace, the stately grace of which may be compared
to the faultless form of some high-bred dame,
or the artful yet seemingly simple modulations of
such a tune as we have been now composing."</p>

<p>The King seemed disposed to take his instrument,
and indulge the youth with a rehearsal of
the strain he had just arranged; but Arthur at that
moment experienced the painful internal feeling
of that peculiar species of shame which well-constructed
minds feel when they see others express
a great assumption of importance, with a confidence
that they are exciting admiration, when in
fact they are only exposing themselves to ridicule.
Arthur, in short, took leave, "in very shame," of
the King of Naples, both the Sicilies, and Jerusalem,
in a manner somewhat more abrupt than
ceremony demanded. The King looked after him,
with some wonder at this want of breeding, which,
however, he imputed to his visitor's insular education,
and then again began to twangle his viol.</p>

<p>"The old fool!" said Arthur. "His daughter
is dethroned, his dominions crumbling to pieces,
his family on the eve of becoming extinct, his
grandson driven from one lurking-place to another,
and expelled from his mother's inheritance,&mdash;and
he can find amusement in these fopperies! I
thought him, with his long white beard, like
Nicholas Bonstetten; but the old Swiss is a Solomon
compared with him."</p>

<p>As these and other reflections, highly disparaging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
to King René, passed through Arthur's mind,
he reached the place of rendezvous, and found
Thiebault beneath the steaming fountain, forced
from one of those hot springs which had been the
delight of the Romans from an early period.
Thiebault, having assured his master that his
retinue, horse and man, were so disposed as to be
ready on an instant's call, readily undertook to
guide him to King René's palace, which, from its
singularity, and indeed its beauty of architecture,
deserved the eulogium which the old monarch had
bestowed upon it. The front consisted of three
towers of Roman architecture, two of them being
placed on the angles of the palace, and the third,
which served the purpose of a mausoleum, forming
a part of the group, though somewhat detached
from the other buildings. This last was a structure
of beautiful proportions. The lower part of the
edifice was square, serving as a sort of pedestal to
the upper part, which was circular, and surrounded
by columns of massive granite. The other two
towers at the angles of the palace were round, and
also ornamented with pillars, and with a double
row of windows. In front of, and connected with,
these Roman remains, to which a date has been
assigned as early as the fifth or sixth century,
arose the ancient palace of the Counts of Provence,
built a century or two later, but where a rich
Gothic or Moorish front contrasted, and yet harmonised,
with the more regular and massive architecture
of the lords of the world. It is not more
than thirty or forty years since this very curious
remnant of antique art was destroyed, to make
room for new public buildings, which have never
yet been erected.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<p>Arthur really experienced some sensation of the
kind which the old King had prophesied, and
stood looking with wonder at the ever-open gate of
the palace, into which men of all kinds seemed
to enter freely. After looking around for a few
minutes, the young Englishman ascended the steps
of a noble portico, and asked of a porter, as old
and as lazy as a great man's domestic ought to be,
for the seneschal named to him by the King. The
corpulent janitor, with great politeness, put the
stranger under the charge of a page, who ushered
him to a chamber, in which he found another aged
functionary of higher rank, with a comely face, a
clear composed eye, and a brow which, having
never been knit into gravity, intimated that the
seneschal of Aix was a proficient in the philosophy
of his royal master. He recognised Arthur the
moment he addressed him.</p>

<p>"You speak northern French, fair sir; you have
lighter hair and a fairer complexion than the
natives of this country&mdash;You ask after Queen
Margaret&mdash;By all these marks I read you English&mdash;Her
Grace of England is at this moment paying
a vow at the monastery of Mont St. Victoire, and
if your name be Arthur Philipson, I have commission
to forward you to her presence immediately&mdash;that
is, as soon as you have tasted of the royal
provision."</p>

<p>The young man would have remonstrated, but
the seneschal left him no leisure.</p>

<p>"Meat and mass," he said, "never hindered
work&mdash;it is perilous to youth to journey too far
on an empty stomach&mdash;he himself would take a
mouthful with the Queen's guest, and pledge him
to boot in a flask of old Hermitage."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>The board was covered with an alacrity which
showed that hospitality was familiarly exercised
in King René's dominions. Pasties, dishes of
game, the gallant boar's head, and other delicacies
were placed on the table, and the seneschal played
the merry host, frequently apologising (unnecessarily)
for showing an indifferent example, as it was
his duty to carve before King René, and the good
King was never pleased unless he saw him feed
lustily as well as carve featly.</p>

<p>"But for you, Sir Guest, eat freely, since you
may not see food again till sunset; for the good
Queen takes her misfortunes so to heart that sighs
are her food, and her tears a bottle of drink, as the
Psalmist hath it. But I bethink me you will need
steeds for yourself and your equipage to reach Mont
St. Victoire, which is seven miles from Aix."</p>

<p>Arthur intimated that he had a guide and horses
in attendance, and begged permission to take his
adieu. The worthy seneschal, his fair round belly
graced with a gold chain, accompanied him to the
gate with a step which a gentle fit of the gout had
rendered uncertain, but which, he assured Arthur,
would vanish before three days' use of the hot
springs. Thiebault appeared before the gate, not
with the tired steeds from which they had dismounted
an hour since, but with fresh palfreys
from the stable of the King.</p>

<p>"They are yours from the moment you have put
foot in stirrup," said the seneschal; "the good
King René never received back as his property a
horse which he had lent to a guest; and that is
perhaps one reason why his Highness and we of
his household must walk often a-foot."</p>

<p>Here the seneschal exchanged greetings with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
young visitor, who rode forth to seek Queen Margaret's
place of temporary retirement at the celebrated
monastery of St. Victoire. He demanded
of his guide in which direction it lay, who pointed,
with an air of triumph, to a mountain three thousand
feet and upwards in height, which arose at
five or six miles' distance from the town, and which
its bold and rocky summit rendered the most distinguished
object of the landscape. Thiebault
spoke of it with unusual glee and energy, so much
so as to lead Arthur to conceive that his trusty
squire had not neglected to avail himself of the
lavish hospitality of <i>Le bon Roy René</i>. Thiebault,
however, continued to expatiate on the fame of
the mountain and monastery. They derived
their name, he said, from a great victory which
was gained by a Roman general, named Caio
Mario, against two large armies of Saracens with
ultramontane names (the Teutones probably and
Cimbri), in gratitude to Heaven for which victory
Caio Mario vowed to build a monastery on the
mountain, for the service of the Virgin Mary, in
honour of whom he had been baptised. With all
the importance of a local connoisseur, Thiebault
proceeded to prove his general assertion by specific
facts.</p>

<p>"Yonder," he said, "was the camp of the Saracens,
from which, when the battle was apparently
decided, their wives and women rushed, with horrible
screams, dishevelled hair, and the gestures
of furies, and for a time prevailed in stopping the
flight of the men." He pointed out, too, the
river, for access to which, cut off by the superior
generalship of the Romans, the barbarians, whom
he called Saracens, hazarded the action, and whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
streams they empurpled with their blood. In
short, he mentioned many circumstances which
showed how accurately tradition will preserve the
particulars of ancient events, even whilst forgetting,
misstating, and confounding dates and persons.</p>

<p>Perceiving that Arthur lent him a not unwilling
ear,&mdash;for it may be supposed that the education
of a youth bred up in the heat of civil wars was
not well qualified to criticise his account of the
wars of a distant period,&mdash;the Provençal, when
he had exhausted this topic, drew up close to his
master's side, and asked, in a suppressed tone,
whether he knew, or was desirous of being made
acquainted with, the cause of Margaret's having
left Aix, to establish herself in the monastery of
St. Victoire?</p>

<p>"For the accomplishment of a vow," answered
Arthur; "all the world knows it."</p>

<p>"All Aix knows the contrary," said Thiebault;
"and I can tell you the truth, so I were sure it
would not offend your seignorie."</p>

<p>"The truth can offend no reasonable man, so it
be expressed in the terms of which Queen Margaret
must be spoken in the presence of an Englishman."</p>

<p>Thus replied Arthur, willing to receive what
information he could gather, and desirous, at the
same time, to check the petulance of his attendant.</p>

<p>"I have nothing," replied his follower, "to state
in disparagement of the gracious Queen, whose
only misfortune is that, like her royal father, she
has more titles than towns. Besides, I know well
that you Englishmen, though you speak wildly of
your sovereigns yourselves, will not permit others
to fail in respect to them."</p>

<p>"Say on, then," answered Arthur.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<p>"Your seignorie must know, then," said Thiebault,
"that the good King René has been much
disturbed by the deep melancholy which afflicted
Queen Margaret, and has bent himself with all his
power to change it into a gayer humour. He made
entertainments in public and in private; he assembled
minstrels and Troubadours, whose music
and poetry might have drawn smiles from one on
his deathbed. The whole country resounded with
mirth and glee, and the gracious Queen could not
stir abroad in the most private manner, but, before
she had gone a hundred paces, she lighted on an
ambush, consisting of some pretty pageant, or
festivous mummery, composed often by the good
King himself, which interrupted her solitude, in
purpose of relieving her heavy thoughts with some
pleasant pastime. But the Queen's deep melancholy
rejected all these modes of dispelling it, and
at length she confined herself to her own apartments,
and absolutely refused to see even her royal
father, because he generally brought into her presence
those whose productions he thought likely to
soothe her sorrow. Indeed she seemed to hear the
harpers with loathing, and, excepting one wandering
Englishman, who sung a rude and melancholy
ballad, which threw her into a flood of tears,
and to whom she gave a chain of price, she never
seemed to look at, or be conscious of the presence
of any one. And at length, as I have had the
honour to tell your seignorie, she refused to see
even her royal father unless he came alone; and
that he found no heart to do."</p>

<p>"I wonder not at it," said the young man. "By
the White Swan, I am rather surprised his mummery
drove her not to frenzy."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<p>"Something like it indeed took place," said
Thiebault; "and I will tell your seignorie how it
chanced. You must know that good King René,
unwilling to abandon his daughter to the foul fiend
of melancholy, bethought him of making a grand
effort. You must know, further, that the King,
powerful in all the craft of Troubadours and Jongleurs,
is held in peculiar esteem for conducting
mysteries, and other of those gamesome and delightful
sports and processions, with which our Holy
Church permits her graver ceremonies to be relieved
and diversified, to the cheering of the hearts of all
true children of religion. It is admitted that no
one has ever been able to approach his excellence
in the arrangement of the Fête-Dieu; and the
tune to which the devils cudgel King Herod, to
the great edification of all Christian spectators, is
of our good King's royal composition. He hath
danced at Tarasconne in the ballet of St. Martha
and the Dragon, and was accounted in his own
person the only actor competent to present the
Tarrasque. His Highness introduced also a new
ritual into the consecration of the Boy Bishop, and
composed an entire set of grotesque music for the
Festival of Asses. In short, his Grace's strength
lies in those pleasing and becoming festivities
which strew the path of edification with flowers,
and send men dancing and singing on their way to
heaven.</p>

<p>"Now the good King René, feeling his own
genius for such recreative compositions, resolved
to exert it to the utmost, in the hope that he
might thereby relieve the melancholy in which
his daughter was plunged, and which infected all
that approached her. It chanced, some short time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
since, that the Queen was absent for certain days,
I know not where or on what business, but it gave
the good King time to make his preparations. So,
when his daughter returned, he with much importunity
prevailed on her to make part of a
religious procession to St. Sauveur, the principal
church in Aix. The Queen, innocent of what was
intended, decked herself with solemnity, to witness
and partake of what she expected would
prove a work of grave piety. But no sooner had
she appeared on the esplanade in front of the
palace, than more than a hundred masks, dressed
up like Turks, Jews, Saracens, Moors, and I know
not whom besides, crowded around, to offer her
their homage, in the character of the Queen of
Sheba; and a grotesque piece of music called them
to arrange themselves for a ludicrous ballet, in
which they addressed the Queen in the most entertaining
manner, and with the most extravagant
gestures. The Queen, stunned with the noise,
and affronted with the petulance of this unexpected
onset, would have gone back into the
palace; but the doors had been shut by the King's
order so soon as she set forth, and her retreat in
that direction was cut off. Finding herself excluded
from the palace, the Queen advanced to the
front of the façade, and endeavoured by signs and
words to appease the hubbub, but the maskers,
who had their instructions, only answered with
songs, music, and shouts."</p>

<p>"I would," said Arthur, "there had been a score
of English yeomen in presence, with their quarterstaves,
to teach the bawling villains respect for
one that has worn the crown of England!"</p>

<p>"All the noise that was made before was silence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
and soft music," continued Thiebault, "till that
when the good King himself appeared, grotesquely
dressed in the character of King Solomon"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"To whom, of all princes, he has the least
resemblance," said Arthur&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"With such capers and gesticulations of welcome
to the Queen of Sheba as, I am assured by
those who saw it, would have brought a dead man
alive again, or killed a living man with laughing.
Among other properties, he had in his hand a truncheon,
somewhat formed like a fool's bauble"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"A most fit sceptre for such a sovereign," said
Arthur&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Which was headed," continued Thiebault, "by
a model of the Jewish Temple, finely gilded and
curiously cut in pasteboard. He managed this
with the utmost grace, and delighted every spectator
by his gaiety and activity, excepting the
Queen, who, the more he skipped and capered,
seemed to be the more incensed, until, on his
approaching her to conduct her to the procession,
she seemed roused to a sort of frenzy, struck the
truncheon out of his hand, and breaking through
the crowd, who felt as if a tigress had leapt amongst
them from a showman's cart, rushed into the royal
courtyard. Ere the order of the scenic representation,
which her violence had interrupted, could be
restored, the Queen again issued forth, mounted
and attended by two or three English cavaliers of
her Majesty's suite. She forced her way through
the crowd, without regarding either their safety
or her own, flew like a hail-storm along the
streets, and never drew bridle till she was as far
up this same Mont St. Victoire as the road would
permit. She was then received into the convent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
and has since remained there; and a vow of penance
is the pretext to cover over the quarrel betwixt her
and her father."</p>

<p>"How long may it be," said Arthur, "since
these things chanced?"</p>

<p>"It is but three days since Queen Margaret left
Aix in the manner I have told you.&mdash;But we are
come as far up the mountain as men usually ride.
See, yonder is the monastery rising betwixt two
huge rocks, which form the very top of Mont St.
Victoire. There is no more open ground than is
afforded by the cleft, into which the convent of St.
Mary of Victory is, as it were, niched; and the
access is guarded by the most dangerous precipices.
To ascend the mountain, you must keep that narrow
path, which, winding and turning among the
cliffs, leads at length to the summit of the hill,
and the gate of the monastery."</p>

<p>"And what becomes of you and the horses?"
said Arthur.</p>

<p>"We will rest," said Thiebault, "in the hospital
maintained by the good fathers at the bottom
of the mountain, for the accommodation of those
who attend on pilgrims;&mdash;for I promise you the
shrine is visited by many who come from afar,
and are attended both by man and horse.&mdash;Care
not for me,&mdash;I shall be first under cover; but
there muster yonder in the west some threatening
clouds, from which your seignorie may suffer inconvenience,
unless you reach the convent in time.
I will give you an hour to do the feat, and will
say you are as active as a chamois-hunter if you
reach it within the time."</p>

<p>Arthur looked around him, and did indeed
remark a mustering of clouds in the distant west,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
which threatened soon to change the character of
the day, which had hitherto been brilliantly clear,
and so serene that the falling of a leaf might have
been heard. He therefore turned him to the steep
and rocky path which ascended the mountain,
sometimes by scaling almost precipitous rocks, and
sometimes by reaching their tops by a more circuitous
process. It winded through thickets of
wild boxwood and other low aromatic shrubs,
which afforded some pasture for the mountain
goats, but were a bitter annoyance to the traveller
who had to press through them. Such obstacles
were so frequent, that the full hour allowed by
Thiebault had elapsed before he stood on the
summit of Mont St. Victoire, and in front of
the singular convent of the same name.</p>

<p>We have already said that the crest of the mountain,
consisting entirely of one bare and solid rock,
was divided by a cleft or opening into two heads
or peaks, between which the convent was built,
occupying all the space between them. The front
of the building was of the most ancient and sombre
cast of the old Gothic, or rather, as it has been
termed, the Saxon; and in that respect corresponded
with the savage exterior of the naked
cliffs, of which the structure seemed to make a
part, and by which it was entirely surrounded,
excepting a small open space of more level ground,
where, at the expense of much toil, and by carrying
earth up the hill, from different spots where
they could collect it in small quantities, the good
fathers had been able to arrange the accommodations
of a garden.</p>

<p>A bell summoned a lay brother, the porter of
this singularly situated monastery, to whom Arthur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
announced himself as an English merchant, Philipson
by name, who came to pay his duty to Queen
Margaret. The porter, with much respect, showed
the stranger into the convent, and ushered him
into a parlour, which, looking towards Aix, commanded
an extensive and splendid prospect over
the southern and western parts of Provence. This
was the direction in which Arthur had approached
the mountain from Aix; but the circuitous path
by which he had ascended had completely carried
him round the hill. The western side of the monastery,
to which the parlour looked, commanded
the noble view we have mentioned; and a species
of balcony, which, connecting the two twin crags,
at this place not above four or five yards asunder,
ran along the front of the building, and appeared
to be constructed for the purpose of enjoying it.
But on stepping from one of the windows of the
parlour upon this battlemented bartizan, Arthur
became aware that the wall on which the parapet
rested stretched along the edge of a precipice,
which sank sheer down five hundred feet at least
from the foundations of the convent. Surprised
and startled at finding himself on so giddy a verge,
Arthur turned his eyes from the gulf beneath him
to admire the distant landscape, partly illumined,
with ominous lustre, by the now westerly sun.
The setting beams showed in dark red splendour a
vast variety of hill and dale, champaign and cultivated
ground, with towns, churches, and castles,
some of which rose from among trees, while others
seemed founded on rocky eminences; others again
lurked by the side of streams or lakes, to which
the heat and drought of the climate naturally
attracted them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>The rest of the landscape presented similar
objects when the weather was serene, but they
were now rendered indistinct, or altogether obliterated,
by the sullen shade of the approaching
clouds, which gradually spread over great part of
the horizon, and threatened altogether to eclipse
the sun, though the lord of the horizon still struggled
to maintain his influence, and, like a dying
hero, seemed most glorious even in the moment
of defeat. Wild sounds, like groans and howls,
formed by the wind in the numerous caverns of
the rocky mountain, added to the terrors of the
scene, and seemed to foretell the fury of some distant
storm, though the air in general was even
unnaturally calm and breathless. In gazing on
this extraordinary scene, Arthur did justice to the
monks who had chosen this wild and grotesque
situation, from which they could witness Nature
in her wildest and grandest demonstrations, and
compare the nothingness of humanity with her
awful convulsions.</p>

<p>So much was Arthur awed by the scene before
him, that he had almost forgotten, while gazing
from the bartizan, the important business which
had brought him to this place, when it was suddenly
recalled by finding himself in the presence
of Margaret of Anjou, who, not seeing him in the
parlour of reception, had stept upon the balcony,
that she might meet with him the sooner.</p>

<p>The Queen's dress was black, without any ornament
except a gold coronal of an inch in breadth,
restraining her long black tresses, of which advancing
years and misfortunes had partly altered
the hue. There was placed within the circlet a
black plume with a red rose, the last of the season,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
which the good father who kept the garden had
presented to her that morning, as the badge of
her husband's house. Care, fatigue, and sorrow
seemed to dwell on her brow and her features. To
another messenger she would in all probability
have administered a sharp rebuke, for not being
alert in his duty to receive her as she entered; but
Arthur's age and appearance corresponded with
that of her loved and lost son. He was the son
of a lady whom Margaret had loved with almost
sisterly affection, and the presence of Arthur continued
to excite in the dethroned Queen the same
feelings of maternal tenderness which had been
awakened on their first meeting in the Cathedral
of Strasburg. She raised him as he kneeled at
her feet, spoke to him with much kindness, and
encouraged him to detail at full length his father's
message, and such other news as his brief residence
at Dijon had made him acquainted with.</p>

<p>She demanded which way Duke Charles had
moved with his army.</p>

<p>"As I was given to understand by the master
of his artillery," said Arthur, "towards the Lake
of Neufchatel, on which side he proposes his first
attack on the Swiss."</p>

<p>"The headstrong fool!" said Queen Margaret.
"He resembles the poor lunatic, who went to the
summit of the mountain that he might meet the
rain halfway.&mdash;Does thy father, then," continued
Margaret, "advise me to give up the last remains
of the extensive territories once the dominions of
our royal house, and for some thousand crowns,
and the paltry aid of a few hundred lances, to relinquish
what is left of our patrimony to our proud
and selfish kinsman of Burgundy, who extends his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
claim to our all, and affords so little help, or
even promise of help, in return?"</p>

<p>"I should have ill discharged my father's commission,"
said Arthur, "if I had left your Highness
to think that he recommends so great a
sacrifice. He feels most deeply the Duke of
Burgundy's grasping desire of dominion. Nevertheless,
he thinks that Provence must, on King
René's death, or sooner, fall either to the share
of Duke Charles, or to Louis of France, whatever
opposition your Highness may make to such a
destination; and it may be that my father, as a
knight and a soldier, hopes much from obtaining
the means to make another attempt on Britain.
But the decision must rest with your Highness."</p>

<p>"Young man," said the Queen, "the contemplation
of a question so doubtful almost deprives
me of reason!"</p>

<p>As she spoke, she sank down, as one who needs
rest, on a stone seat placed on the very verge of
the balcony, regardless of the storm, which now
began to rise with dreadful gusts of wind, the
course of which being intermitted and altered by
the crags round which they howled, it seemed as
if in very deed Boreas, and Eurus, and Caurus,
unchaining the winds from every quarter of heaven,
were contending for mastery around the convent
of Our Lady of Victory. Amid this tumult, and
amid billows of mist which concealed the bottom
of the precipice, and masses of clouds which racked
fearfully over their heads, the roar of the descending
waters rather resembled the fall of cataracts
than the rushing of torrents of rain. The seat
on which Margaret had placed herself was in a
considerable degree sheltered from the storm, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
its eddies, varying in every direction, often tossed
aloft her dishevelled hair; and we cannot describe
the appearance of her noble and beautiful, yet
ghastly and wasted features, agitated strongly by
anxious hesitation and conflicting thoughts, unless
to those of our readers who have had the advantage
of having seen our inimitable Siddons in such a
character as this. Arthur, confounded by anxiety
and terror, could only beseech her Majesty to retire
before the fury of the approaching storm into the
interior of the convent.</p>

<p>"No," she replied with firmness; "roofs and
walls have ears, and monks, though they have forsworn
the world, are not the less curious to know
what passes beyond their cells. It is in this place
you must hear what I have to say; as a soldier
you should scorn a blast of wind or a shower of
rain; and to me, who have often held counsel
amidst the sound of trumpets and clash of arms,
prompt for instant fight, the war of elements is an
unnoticed trifle. I tell thee, young Arthur Vere,
as I would to your father&mdash;as I would to my son&mdash;if
indeed Heaven had left such a blessing to a
wretch forlorn"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She paused, and then proceeded.</p>

<p>"I tell thee, as I would have told my beloved
Edward, that Margaret, whose resolutions were
once firm and immovable as these rocks among
which we are placed, is now doubtful and variable
as the clouds which are drifting around us. I
told your father, in the joy of meeting once more
a subject of such inappreciable loyalty, of the sacrifices
I would make to assure the assistance of
Charles of Burgundy, to so gallant an undertaking
as that proposed to him by the faithful Oxford.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
But since I saw him I have had cause of deep
reflection. I met my aged father only to offend
and, I say it with shame, to insult the old man in
presence of his people. Our tempers are as opposed
as the sunshine, which a short space since gilded
a serene and beautiful landscape, differs from the
tempests which are now wasting it. I spurned
with open scorn and contempt what he, in his
mistaken affection, had devised for means of consolation,
and, disgusted with the idle follies
which he had devised for curing the melancholy
of a dethroned Queen, a widowed spouse&mdash;and,
alas! a childless mother,&mdash;I retired hither from
the noisy and idle mirth, which was the bitterest
aggravation of my sorrows. Such and so gentle is
René's temper, that even my unfilial conduct will
not diminish my influence over him; and if your
father had announced that the Duke of Burgundy,
like a knight and a sovereign, had cordially and
nobly entered into the plan of the faithful Oxford,
I could have found it in my heart to obtain the
cession of territory his cold and ambitious policy
requires, in order to insure the assistance which
he now postpones to afford till he has gratified his
own haughty humour by settling needless quarrels
with his unoffending neighbours. Since I have
been here, and calmness and solitude have given
me time to reflect, I have thought on the offences
I have given the old man, and on the wrongs I
was about to do him. My father, let me do him
justice, is also the father of his people. They
have dwelt under their vines and fig-trees, in
ignoble ease, perhaps, but free from oppression
and exaction, and their happiness has been that
of their good King. Must I change all this?&mdash;Must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
I aid in turning over these contented people
to a fierce, headlong, arbitrary prince?&mdash;May I
not break even the easy and thoughtless heart of
my poor old father, should I succeed in urging
him to do so?&mdash;These are questions which I
shudder even to ask myself. On the other hand,
to disappoint the toils, the venturous hopes of
your father, to forego the only opportunity which
may ever again offer itself, of revenge on the
bloody traitors of York, and restoration of the
House of Lancaster!&mdash;Arthur, the scene around
us is not so convulsed by the fearful tempest and
the driving clouds, as my mind is by doubt and
uncertainty."</p>

<p>"Alas," replied Arthur, "I am too young and
inexperienced to be your Majesty's adviser in a
case so arduous. I would my father had been in
presence himself."</p>

<p>"I know what he would have said," replied the
Queen; "but, knowing all, I despair of aid from
human counsellors&mdash;I have sought others, but
they also are deaf to my entreaties. Yes, Arthur,
Margaret's misfortunes have rendered her superstitious.
Know, that beneath these rocks, and
under the foundation of this convent, there runs
a cavern, entering by a secret and defended passage
a little to the westward of the summit, and
running through the mountain, having an opening
to the south, from which, as from this bartizan,
you can view the landscape so lately seen from
this balcony, or the strife of winds and confusion
of clouds which we now behold. In the middle
of this cavernous thoroughfare is a natural pit, or
perforation, of great but unknown depth. A stone
dropped into it is heard to dash from side to side,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
until the noise of its descent, thundering from
cliff to cliff, dies away in distant and faint tinkling,
less loud than that of a sheep's bell at a
mile's distance. The common people, in their
jargon, call this fearful gulf Lou Garagoule; and
the traditions of the monastery annex wild and
fearful recollections to a place in itself sufficiently
terrible. Oracles, it is said, spoke from thence in
pagan days, by subterranean voices, arising from
the abyss; and from these the Roman general is
said to have heard, in strange and uncouth rhymes,
promises of the victory which gives name to this
mountain. These oracles, it is averred, may be
yet consulted after performance of strange rites, in
which heathen ceremonies are mixed with Christian
acts of devotion. The abbots of Mont St.
Victoire have denounced the consultation of Lou
Garagoule, and the spirits who reside there, to be
criminal. But as the sin may be expiated by
presents to the Church, by masses, and penances,
the door is sometimes opened by the complaisant
fathers to those whose daring curiosity leads them,
at all risks, and by whatever means, to search into
futurity. Arthur, I have made the experiment,
and am even now returned from the gloomy cavern,
in which, according to the traditional ritual, I
have spent six hours by the margin of the gulf, a
place so dismal, that after its horrors even this
tempestuous scene is refreshing."</p>

<p>The Queen stopped, and Arthur, the more
struck with the wild tale that it reminded him of
his place of imprisonment at La Ferette, asked
anxiously if her inquiries had obtained any
answer.</p>

<p>"None whatever," replied the unhappy Princess.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
"The demons of Garagoule, if there be such, are
deaf to the suit of an unfortunate wretch like me,
to whom neither friends nor fiends will afford
counsel or assistance. It is my father's circumstances
which prevent my instant and strong resolution.
Were my own claims on this piping and
paltry nation of Troubadours alone interested, I
could, for the chance of once more setting my foot
in merry England, as easily and willingly resign
them, and their paltry coronet, as I commit to the
storm this idle emblem of the royal rank which I
have lost."</p>

<p>As Margaret spoke, she tore from her hair the
sable feather and rose which the tempest had
detached from the circlet in which they were
placed, and tossed them from the battlement with
a gesture of wild energy. They were instantly
whirled off in a bickering eddy of the agitated
clouds, which swept the feather far distant into
empty space, through which the eye could not
pursue it. But while that of Arthur involuntarily
strove to follow its course, a contrary gust of wind
caught the red rose, and drove it back against his
breast, so that it was easy for him to catch hold
of and retain it.</p>

<p>"Joy, joy, and good fortune, royal mistress!"
he said, returning to her the emblematic flower;
"the tempest brings back the badge of Lancaster to
its proper owner."</p>

<p>"I accept the omen," said Margaret; "but it
concerns yourself, noble youth, and not me. The
feather, which is borne away to waste and desolation,
is Margaret's emblem. My eyes will never
see the restoration of the line of Lancaster. But
you will live to behold it, and to aid to achieve it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
and to dye our red rose deeper yet in the blood of
tyrants and traitors. My thoughts are so strangely
poised, that a feather or a flower may turn the
scale. But my head is still giddy, and my heart
sick.&mdash;To-morrow you shall see another Margaret,
and till then adieu."</p>

<p>It was time to retire, for the tempest began to
be mingled with fiercer showers of rain. When
they re-entered the parlour, the Queen clapped her
hands, and two female attendants entered.</p>

<p>"Let the Father Abbot know," she said, "that
it is our desire that this young gentleman receive
for this night such hospitality as befits an esteemed
friend of ours.&mdash;Till to-morrow, young sir, farewell."</p>

<p>With a countenance which betrayed not the late
emotion of her mind, and with a stately courtesy
that would have become her when she graced the
halls of Windsor, she extended her hand, which
the youth saluted respectfully. After her leaving
the parlour, the Abbot entered, and, in his attention
to Arthur's entertainment and accommodation
for the evening, showed his anxiety to meet and
obey Queen Margaret's wishes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i10">Want you a man</p>
<p>Experienced in the world and its affairs?</p>
<p>Here he is for your purpose.&mdash;He's a monk.</p>
<p>He hath forsworn the world and all its work&mdash;</p>
<p>The rather that he knows it passing well,</p>
<p>Special the worst of it, for he's a monk.</p>

<p class="i12"><i>Old Play.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>While the dawn of the morning was yet grey,
Arthur was awakened by a loud ringing at the
gate of the monastery, and presently afterwards
the porter entered the cell which had been allotted
to him for his lodgings, to tell him that, if his
name was Arthur Philipson, a brother of their
order had brought him despatches from his father.
The youth started up, hastily attired himself, and
was introduced, in the parlour, to a Carmelite
monk, being of the same order with the community
of St. Victoire.</p>

<p>"I have ridden many a mile, young man, to
present you with this letter," said the monk,
"having undertaken to your father that it should
be delivered without delay. I came to Aix last
night during the storm, and, learning at the palace
that you had ridden hither, I mounted as soon as
the tempest abated, and here I am."</p>

<p>"I am beholden to you, father," said the youth,
"and if I could repay your pains with a small
donative to your convent"&mdash;&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p>"By no means," answered the good father; "I
took my personal trouble out of friendship to your
father, and mine own errand led me this way.
The expenses of my long journey have been amply
provided for. But open your packet, I can answer
your questions at leisure."</p>

<p>The young man accordingly stepped into an
embrasure of the window, and read as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Son Arthur</span>,&mdash;Touching the state of the country,
in so far as concerns the safety of travelling, know that
the same is precarious. The Duke hath taken the towns
of Brie and Granson, and put to death five hundred
men, whom he made prisoners in garrison there. But
the Confederates are approaching with a large force,
and God will judge for the right. Howsoever the game
may go, these are sharp wars, in which little quarter
is spoken of on either side, and therefore there is
no safety for men of our profession, till something decisive
shall happen. In the meantime, you may assure
the widowed lady, that our correspondent continues
well disposed to purchase the property which she has
in hand; but will scarce be able to pay the price till
his present pressing affairs shall be settled, which I
hope will be in time to permit us to embark the funds
in the profitable adventure I told our friend of. I
have employed a friar, travelling to Provence, to carry
this letter, which I trust will come safe. The bearer
may be trusted.</p>

<p class="left45">
"Your affectionate father,</p>

<p class="left65">"<span class="smcap">John Philipson</span>."</p>
</div>
<p>Arthur easily comprehended the latter part of
the epistle, and rejoiced he had received it at so
critical a moment. He questioned the Carmelite
on the amount of the Duke's army, which the
monk stated to amount to sixty thousand men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
while he said the Confederates, though making
every exertion, had not yet been able to assemble
the third part of that number. The young Ferrand
de Vaudemont was with their army, and had
received, it was thought, some secret assistance
from France; but as he was little known in arms,
and had few followers, the empty title of General
which he bore added little to the strength of the
Confederates. Upon the whole, he reported that
every chance appeared to be in favour of Charles,
and Arthur, who looked upon his success as presenting
the only chance in favour of his father's
enterprise, was not a little pleased to find it insured,
as far as depended on a great superiority of
force. He had no leisure to make further inquiries,
for the Queen at that moment entered the apartment,
and the Carmelite, learning her quality,
withdrew from her presence in deep reverence.</p>

<p>The paleness of her complexion still bespoke the
fatigues of the day preceding; but, as she graciously
bestowed on Arthur the greetings of the morning,
her voice was firm, her eye clear, and her countenance
steady. "I meet you," she said, "not as I
left you, but determined in my purpose. I am
satisfied that if René does not voluntarily yield
up his throne of Provence by some step like that
which we propose, he will be hurled from it by
violence, in which, it may be, his life will not
be spared. We will, therefore, to work with all
speed&mdash;the worst is, that I cannot leave this convent
till I have made the necessary penances for
having visited the Garagoule, without performing
which I were no Christian woman. When you
return to Aix, inquire at the palace for my secretary,
with whom this line will give you credence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
I have, even before this door of hope opened to me,
endeavoured to form an estimate of King René's
situation, and collected the documents for that
purpose. Tell him to send me, duly sealed, and
under fitting charge, the small cabinet hooped with
silver. Hours of penance for past errors may be
employed to prevent others; and from the contents
of that cabinet I shall learn whether I am, in this
weighty matter, sacrificing my father's interests
to my own half-desperate hopes. But of this I
have little or no doubt. I can cause the deeds of
resignation and transference to be drawn up here
under my own direction, and arrange the execution
of them when I return to Aix, which shall be the
first moment after my penance is concluded."</p>

<p>"And this letter, gracious madam," said Arthur,
"will inform you what events are approaching,
and of what importance it may be to take time by
the forelock. Place me but in possession of these
momentous deeds, and I will travel night and day
till I reach the Duke's camp. I shall find him
most likely in the moment of victory, and with
his heart too much open to refuse a boon to the
royal kinswoman who is surrendering to him all.
We will&mdash;we must&mdash;in such an hour, obtain
princely succours; and we shall soon see if the
licentious Edward of York, the savage Richard,
the treacherous and perjured Clarence, are hereafter
to be lords of merry England, or whether
they must give place to a more rightful sovereign
and better man. But oh! royal madam, all depends
on haste."</p>

<p>"True&mdash;yet a few days may&mdash;nay, must&mdash;cast
the die between Charles and his opponents; and,
ere making so great a surrender, it were as well to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
be assured that he whom we would propitiate is in
capacity to assist us. All the events of a tragic and
varied life have led me to see there is no such thing
as an inconsiderable enemy. I will make haste,
however, trusting in the interim we may have good
news from the banks of the lake at Neufchatel."</p>

<p>"But who shall be employed to draw these most
important deeds?" said the young man.</p>

<p>Margaret mused ere she replied,&mdash;"The Father
Guardian is complaisant, and I think faithful; but
I would not willingly repose confidence in one of
the Provençal monks. Stay, let me think&mdash;your
father says the Carmelite who brought the letter
may be trusted&mdash;he shall do the turn. He is a
stranger, and will be silent for a piece of money.
Farewell, Arthur de Vere.&mdash;You will be treated
with all hospitality by my father. If thou dost
receive further tidings, thou wilt let me know
them; or, should I have instructions to send, thou
wilt hear from me.&mdash;So, benedicite."</p>

<p>Arthur proceeded to wind down the mountain
at a much quicker pace than he had ascended on
the day before. The weather was now gloriously
serene, and the beauties of vegetation, in a country
where it never totally slumbers, were at once delicious
and refreshing. His thoughts wandered from
the crags of Mont St. Victoire to the cliff of the
canton of Unterwalden, and fancy recalled the
moments when his walks through such scenery
were not solitary, but when there was a form by
his side whose simple beauty was engraved on his
memory. Such thoughts were of a preoccupying
nature; and I grieve to say that they entirely
drowned the recollection of the mysterious caution
given him by his father, intimating that Arthur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
might not be able to comprehend such letters as
he should receive from him, till they were warmed
before a fire.</p>

<p>The first thing which reminded him of this
singular caution was the seeing a chafing-dish of
charcoal in the kitchen of the hostelry at the bottom
of the mountain, where he found Thiebault
and his horses. This was the first fire which he
had seen since receiving his father's letter, and it
reminded him not unnaturally of what the Earl
had recommended. Great was his surprise to see
that, after exposing the paper to the fire as if to
dry it, a word emerged in an important passage of
the letter, and the concluding words now read,&mdash;"The
bearer may <i>not</i> be trusted." Well-nigh
choked with shame and vexation, Arthur could
think of no other remedy than instantly to return
to the convent, and acquaint the Queen with this
discovery, which he hoped still to convey to her
in time to prevent any risk being incurred by the
Carmelite's treachery.</p>

<p>Incensed at himself, and eager to redeem his
fault, he bent his manly breast against the steep
hill, which was probably never scaled in so short
time as by the young heir of De Vere; for, within
forty minutes from his commencing the ascent, he
stood breathless and panting in the presence of
Queen Margaret, who was alike surprised at his
appearance and his exhausted condition.</p>

<p>"Trust not the Carmelite!" he exclaimed&mdash;"You
are betrayed, noble Queen, and it is by my
negligence. Here is my dagger&mdash;bid me strike
it into my heart!"</p>

<p>Margaret demanded and obtained a more special
explanation, and when it was given she said, "It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
is an unhappy chance; but your father's instructions
ought to have been more distinct. I have
told yonder Carmelite the purpose of the contracts,
and engaged with him to draw them. He has but
now left me to serve at the choir. There is no
withdrawing the confidence I have unhappily
placed; but I can easily prevail with the Father
Guardian to prevent the monk from leaving the
convent till we are indifferent to his secrecy. It
is our best chance to secure it, and we will take
care that what inconvenience he sustains by his
detention shall be well recompensed. Meanwhile,
rest thou, good Arthur, and undo the throat of thy
mantle. Poor youth, thou art well-nigh exhausted
with thy haste."</p>

<p>Arthur obeyed, and sat down on a seat in the
parlour; for the speed which he had exerted rendered
him almost incapable of standing.</p>

<p>"If I could but see," he said, "the false monk,
I would find a way to charm him to secrecy!"</p>

<p>"Better leave him to me," said the Queen;
"and, in a word, I forbid you to meddle with
him. The coif can treat better with the cowl
than the casque can do. Say no more of him. I
joy to see you wear around your neck the holy
relic I bestowed on you;&mdash;but what Moorish
charmlet is that you wear beside it? Alas! I
need not ask. Your heightened colour, almost as
deep as when you entered a quarter of an hour
hence, confesses a true-love token. Alas! poor
boy, hast thou not only such a share of thy country's
woes to bear, but also thine own load of
affliction, not the less poignant now that future
time will show thee how fantastic it is! Margaret
of Anjou could once have aided wherever thy affections
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
were placed; but now she can only contribute
to the misery of her friends, not to their happiness.
But this lady of the charm, Arthur, is she
fair&mdash;is she wise and virtuous&mdash;is she of noble
birth&mdash;and does she love?"&mdash;She perused his
countenance with the glance of an eagle, and continued,
"To all, thou wouldst answer Yes, if
shamefacedness permitted thee. Love her then in
turn, my gallant boy, for love is the parent of
brave actions. Go, my noble youth&mdash;high-born
and loyal, valorous and virtuous, enamoured and
youthful, to what mayst thou not rise? The chivalry
of ancient Europe only lives in a bosom like
thine. Go, and let the praises of a Queen fire thy
bosom with the love of honour and achievement.
In three days we meet at Aix."</p>

<p>Arthur, highly gratified with the Queen's condescension,
once more left her presence.</p>

<p>Returning down the mountain with a speed very
different from that which he had used in the
ascent, he again found his Provençal squire, who
had remained in much surprise at witnessing the
confusion in which his master had left the inn,
almost immediately after he had entered it without
any apparent haste or agitation. Arthur explained
his hasty return by alleging he had forgot
his purse at the convent. "Nay, in that case,"
said Thiebault, "considering what you left and
where you left it, I do not wonder at your speed,
though, Our Lady save me, as I never saw living
creature, save a goat with a wolf at his heels,
make his way over crag and briers with half such
rapidity as you did."</p>

<p>They reached Aix after about an hour's riding,
and Arthur lost no time in waiting upon the good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
King René, who gave him a kind reception, both
in respect of the letter from the Duke of Burgundy,
and in consideration of his being an Englishman,
the avowed subject of the unfortunate Margaret.
The placable monarch soon forgave his young guest
the want of complaisance with which he had
eschewed to listen to his compositions; and Arthur
speedily found that to apologise for his want of
breeding in that particular was likely to lead to
a great deal more rehearsing than he could find
patience to tolerate. He could only avoid the old
King's extreme desire to recite his own poems,
and perform his own music, by engaging him in
speaking of his daughter Margaret. Arthur had
been sometimes induced to doubt the influence
which the Queen boasted herself to possess over
her aged father; but, on being acquainted with
him personally, he became convinced that her
powerful understanding and violent passions inspired
the feeble-minded and passive King with a
mixture of pride, affection, and fear, which united
to give her the most ample authority over him.</p>

<p>Although she had parted with him but a day
or two since, and in a manner so ungracious on
her side, René was as much overjoyed at hearing
of the probability of her speedy return, as the
fondest father could have been at the prospect of
being reunited to the most dutiful child, whom
he had not seen for years. The old King was
impatient as a boy for the day of her arrival, and,
still strangely unenlightened on the difference of
her taste from his own, he was with difficulty
induced to lay aside a project of meeting her in
the character of old Palemon,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>The prince of shepherds, and their pride,</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p>at the head of an Arcadian procession of nymphs
and swains, to inspire whose choral dances and
songs every pipe and tambourine in the country
was to be placed in requisition. Even the old
seneschal, however, intimated his disapprobation
of this species of <i>joyeuse entrée</i>; so that René
suffered himself at length to be persuaded that
the Queen was too much occupied by the religious
impressions to which she had been of late exposed,
to receive any agreeable sensation from sights or
sounds of levity. The King gave way to reasons
which he could not sympathise with; and thus
Margaret escaped the shock of welcome, which
would perhaps have driven her in her impatience
back to the mountain of St. Victoire, and the
sable cavern of Lou Garagoule.</p>

<p>During the time of her absence, the days of the
court of Provence were employed in sports and
rejoicings of every description; tilting at the
barrier with blunted spears, riding at the ring,
parties for hare-hunting and falconry, frequented
by the youth of both sexes, in the company of
whom the King delighted, while the evenings
were consumed in dancing and music.</p>

<p>Arthur could not but be sensible that not long
since all this would have made him perfectly
happy; but the last months of his existence had
developed his understanding and passions. He was
now initiated in the actual business of human life,
and looked on its amusements with an air of something
like contempt; so that among the young and
gay noblesse who composed this merry court he acquired
the title of the youthful philosopher, which
was not bestowed upon him, it may be supposed, as
inferring anything of peculiar compliment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span></p>

<p>On the fourth day news was received, by an
express messenger, that Queen Margaret would
enter Aix before the hour of noon, to resume her
residence in her father's palace. The good King
René seemed, as it drew nigh, to fear the interview
with his daughter as much as he had previously
desired it, and contrived to make all
around him partake of his fidgety anxiety. He
tormented his steward and cooks to recollect what
dishes they had ever observed her to taste of with
approbation&mdash;he pressed the musicians to remember
the tunes which she approved; and when one
of them boldly replied he had never known her
Majesty endure any strain with patience, the old
monarch threatened to turn him out of his service
for slandering the taste of his daughter. The
banquet was ordered to be served at half past
eleven, as if accelerating it would have had the
least effect upon hurrying the arrival of the expected
guests; and the old King, with his napkin
over his arm, traversed the hall from window
to window, wearying every one with questions,
whether they saw anything of the Queen of England.
Exactly as the bells tolled noon, the Queen,
with a very small retinue, chiefly English, and in
mourning habits like herself, rode into the town
of Aix. King René, at the head of his court,
failed not to descend from the front of his stately
palace, and move along the street to meet his
daughter. Lofty, proud, and jealous of incurring
ridicule, Margaret was not pleased with this public
greeting in the market-place. But she was
desirous at present to make amends for her late
petulance, and therefore she descended from her
palfrey; and, although something shocked at seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
René equipped with a napkin, she humbled herself
to bend the knee to him, asking at once his blessing
and forgiveness.</p>

<p>"Thou hast&mdash;thou hast my blessing, my suffering
dove," said the simple King to the proudest
and most impatient princess that ever wept for a
lost crown.&mdash;"And for thy pardon, how canst
thou ask it, who never didst me an offence since
God made me father to so gracious a child?&mdash;Rise,
I say rise&mdash;nay, it is for me to ask thy pardon&mdash;True,
I said in my ignorance, and thought
within myself, that my heart had indited a goodly
thing&mdash;but it vexed thee. It is therefore for me
to crave pardon."&mdash;And down sank good King
René upon both knees; and the people, who are
usually captivated with anything resembling the
trick of the scene, applauded with much noise,
and some smothered laughter, a situation in which
the royal daughter and her parent seemed about to
rehearse the scene of the Roman Charity.</p>

<p>Margaret, sensitively alive to shame, and fully
aware that her present position was sufficiently
ludicrous in its publicity at least, signed sharply
to Arthur, whom she saw in the King's suite, to
come to her; and, using his arm to rise, she muttered
to him aside, and in English,&mdash;"To what
saint shall I vow myself, that I may preserve
patience when I so much need it!"</p>

<p>"For pity's sake, royal madam, recall your
firmness of mind and composure," whispered her
esquire, who felt at the moment more embarrassed
than honoured by his distinguished office, for he
could feel that the Queen actually trembled with
vexation and impatience.</p>

<p>They at length resumed their route to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
palace, the father and daughter arm in arm&mdash;a
posture most agreeable to Margaret, who could
bring herself to endure her father's effusions of
tenderness, and the general tone of his conversation,
so that he was not overheard by others. In
the same manner, she bore with laudable patience
the teasing attentions which he addressed to her
at table, noticed some of his particular courtiers,
inquired after others, led the way to his favourite
subjects of conversation on poetry, painting, and
music, till the good King was as much delighted
with the unwonted civilities of his daughter as
ever was lover with the favourable confessions of
his mistress, when, after years of warm courtship,
the ice of her bosom is at length thawed. It cost
the haughty Margaret an effort to bend herself to
play this part&mdash;her pride rebuked her for stooping
to flatter her father's foibles, in order to bring him
over to the resignation of his dominions&mdash;yet
having undertaken to do so, and so much having
been already hazarded upon this sole remaining
chance of success in an attack upon England, she
saw, or was willing to see, no alternative.</p>

<p>Betwixt the banquet and the ball by which it
was to be followed, the Queen sought an opportunity
of speaking to Arthur.</p>

<p>"Bad news, my sage counsellor," she said.
"The Carmelite never returned to the convent
after the service was over. Having learned that
you had come back in great haste, he had, I suppose,
concluded he might stand in suspicion, so
he left the convent of Mont St. Victoire."</p>

<p>"We must hasten the measures which your
Majesty has resolved to adopt," answered Arthur.</p>

<p>"I will speak with my father to-morrow.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
Meanwhile, you must enjoy the pleasures of the
evening, for to you they may be pleasures.&mdash;Young
lady of Boisgelin, I give you this cavalier
to be your partner for the evening."</p>

<p>The black-eyed and pretty Provençale curtseyed
with due decorum, and glanced at the handsome
young Englishman with an eye of approbation;
but whether afraid of his character as a philosopher,
or his doubtful rank, added the saving
clause,&mdash;"If my mother approves."</p>

<p>"Your mother, damsel, will scarce, I think,
disapprove of any partner whom you receive from
the hands of Margaret of Anjou. Happy privilege
of youth," she added with a sigh, as the youthful
couple went off to take their place in the <i>bransle</i>,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>

"which can snatch a flower even on the roughest
road!"</p>

<p>Arthur acquitted himself so well during the
evening, that perhaps the young Countess was only
sorry that so gay and handsome a gallant limited
his compliments and attentions within the cold
bounds of that courtesy enjoined by the rules of
ceremony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>For I have given here my full consent</p>
<p>To undeck the pompous body of a king,</p>
<p>Make glory base, and sovereignty a slave,</p>
<p>Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.</p>

<p class="i12"><i>Richard II.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The next day opened a grave scene. King René
had not forgotten to arrange the pleasures of the
day, when, to his horror and discomfiture, Margaret
demanded an interview upon serious business.
If there was a proposition in the world
which René from his soul detested, it was any
that related to the very name of business.</p>

<p>"What was it that his child wanted?" he said.
"Was it money? He would give her whatever
ready sums he had, though he owned his exchequer
was somewhat bare; yet he had received his income
for the season. It was ten thousand crowns.
How much should he desire to be paid to her?&mdash;the
half&mdash;three parts&mdash;or the whole? All was
at her command."</p>

<p>"Alas, my dear father," said Margaret, "it is
not my affairs, but your own, on which I desire
to speak with you."</p>

<p>"If the affairs are mine," said René, "I am
surely master to put them off to another day&mdash;to
some rainy dull day, fit for no better purpose.
See, my love, the hawking-party are all on their
steeds and ready&mdash;the horses are neighing and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
pawing&mdash;the gallants and maidens mounted, and
ready with hawk on fist&mdash;the spaniels struggling
in the leash. It were a sin, with wind and weather
to friend, to lose so lovely a morning."</p>

<p>"Let them ride their way," said Queen Margaret,
"and find their sport; for the matter I have
to speak concerning involves honour and rank, life
and means of living."</p>

<p>"Nay, but I have to hear and judge between
Calezon and John of Acqua Mortis, the two most
celebrated Troubadours."</p>

<p>"Postpone their cause till to-morrow," said
Margaret, "and dedicate an hour or two to more
important affairs."</p>

<p>"If you are peremptory," replied King René,
"you are aware, my child, I cannot say you
nay."</p>

<p>And with reluctance he gave orders for the
hawkers to go on and follow their sport, as he
could not attend them that day.</p>

<p>The old King then suffered himself, like an unwilling
greyhound withheld from the chase, to be
led into a separate apartment. To insure privacy,
Margaret stationed her secretary Mordaunt, with
Arthur, in an antechamber, giving them orders
to prevent all intrusion.</p>

<p>"Nay, for myself, Margaret," said the good-natured
old man, "since it must be, I consent to
be put <i>au secret</i>; but why keep old Mordaunt from
taking a walk in this beautiful morning; and why
prevent young Arthur from going forth with the
rest? I promise you, though they term him a
philosopher, yet he showed as light a pair of heels
last night, with the young Countess de Boisgelin,
as any gallant in Provence."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>"They are come from a country," said Margaret,
"in which men are trained from infancy to prefer
their duty to their pleasure."</p>

<p>The poor King, led into the council-closet, saw
with internal shuddering the fatal cabinet of
ebony, bound with silver, which had never been
opened but to overwhelm him with weariness, and
dolefully calculated how many yawns he must
strangle ere he sustained the consideration of its
contents. They proved, however, when laid before
him, of a kind that excited even his interest,
though painfully.</p>

<p>His daughter presented him with a short and
clear view of the debts which were secured on his
dominions, and for which they were mortgaged in
various pieces and parcels. She then showed him,
by another schedule, the large claims of which
payment was instantly demanded, to discharge
which no funds could be found or assigned. The
King defended himself like others in his forlorn
situation. To every claim of six, seven, or eight
thousand ducats, he replied by the assertion that
he had ten thousand crowns in his chancery, and
showed some reluctance to be convinced, till repeatedly
urged upon him, that the same sum could
not be adequate to the discharge of thirty times
the amount.</p>

<p>"Then," said the King, somewhat impatiently,
"why not pay off those who are most pressing,
and let the others wait till receipts come round?"</p>

<p>"It is a practice which has been too often
resorted to," replied the Queen, "and it is but a
part of honesty to pay creditors who have advanced
their all in your Grace's service."</p>

<p>"But are we not," said René, "King of both the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
Sicilies, Naples, Arragon, and Jerusalem? And
why is the monarch of such fair kingdoms to be
pushed to the wall, like a bankrupt yeoman, for a
few bags of paltry crowns?"</p>

<p>"You are indeed monarch of these kingdoms,"
said Margaret; "but is it necessary to remind your
Majesty that it is but as I am Queen of England,
in which I have not an acre of land, and cannot
command a penny of revenue? You have no
dominions which are a source of revenue, save
those which you see in this scroll, with an exact
list of the income they afford. It is totally
inadequate, you see, to maintain your state, and
to pay the large engagements incurred to former
creditors."</p>

<p>"It is cruel to press me to the wall thus," said
the poor King. "What can I do? If I am poor,
I cannot help it. I am sure I would pay the debts
you talk of, if I knew the way."</p>

<p>"Royal father, I will show it you.&mdash;Resign
your useless and unavailing dignity, which, with
the pretensions attending it, serves but to make
your miseries ridiculous. Resign your rights as
a sovereign, and the income which cannot be
stretched out to the empty excesses of a beggarly
court will enable you to enjoy, in ease and opulence,
all the pleasures you most delight in, as
a private baron."</p>

<p>"Margaret, you speak folly," answered René,
somewhat sternly. "A king and his people are
bound by ties which neither can sever without
guilt. My subjects are my flock, I am their shepherd.
They are assigned to my governance by
Heaven, and I dare not renounce the charge of
protecting them."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>"Were you in condition to do so," answered the
Queen, "Margaret would bid you fight to the death.
But don your harness, long disused&mdash;mount your
war-steed&mdash;cry, René for Provence! and see if a
hundred men will gather round your standard.
Your fortresses are in the hands of strangers; army
you have none; your vassals may have good-will,
but they lack all military skill and soldierlike
discipline. You stand but the mere skeleton of
monarchy, which France or Burgundy may prostrate
on the earth, whichever first puts forth his
arm to throw it down."</p>

<p>The tears trickled fast down the old King's
cheeks, when this unflattering prospect was set
before him, and he could not forbear owning
his total want of power to defend himself and
his dominions, and admitting that he had often
thought of the necessity of compounding for his
resignation with one of his powerful neighbours.</p>

<p>"It was thy interest, Margaret, harsh and severe
as you are, which prevented my entering, before
now, into measures most painful to my feelings,
but perhaps best calculated for my advantage.
But I had hoped it would hold on for my day;
and thou, my child, with the talents Heaven has
given thee, wouldst, I thought, have found remedy
for distresses which I cannot escape, otherwise
than by shunning the thoughts of them."</p>

<p>"If it is in earnest you speak of my interest,"
said Margaret, "know, that your resigning Provence
will satisfy the nearest, and almost the only
wish that my bosom can form; but, so judge me
Heaven, as it is on your account, gracious sire, as
well as mine, that I advise your compliance."</p>

<p>"Say no more on't, child; give me the parchment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
of resignation, and I will sign it: I see thou
hast it ready drawn; let us sign it, and then
we will overtake the hawkers. We must suffer
woe, but there is little need to sit down and weep
for it."</p>

<p>"Do you not ask," said Margaret, surprised at
his apathy, "to whom you cede your dominions?"</p>

<p>"What boots it," answered the King, "since
they must be no more my own? It must be either
to Charles of Burgundy, or my nephew Louis&mdash;both
powerful and politic princes. God send my
poor people may have no cause to wish their old
man back again, whose only pleasure was to see
them happy and mirthful."</p>

<p>"It is to Burgundy you resign Provence," said
Margaret.</p>

<p>"I would have preferred him," answered René;
"he is fierce, but not malignant. One word more.
Are my subjects' privileges and immunities fully
secured?"</p>

<p>"Amply," replied the Queen; "and your own
wants of all kinds honourably provided for. I
would not leave the stipulations in your favour
in blank, though I might perhaps have trusted
Charles of Burgundy, where money alone is concerned."</p>

<p>"I ask not for myself&mdash;with my viol and my
pencil, René the Troubadour will be as happy as
ever was René the King."</p>

<p>So saying, with practical philosophy he whistled
the burden of his last composed ariette, and signed
away the rest of his royal possessions without pulling
off his glove, or even reading the instrument.</p>

<p>"What is this?" he said, looking at another
and separate parchment of much briefer contents.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
"Must my kinsman Charles have both the Sicilies,
Catalonia, Naples, and Jerusalem, as well as the
poor remainder of Provence? Methinks, in decency,
some greater extent of parchment should
have been allowed to so ample a cession."</p>

<p>"That deed," said Margaret, "only disowns and
relinquishes all countenance of Ferrand de Vaudemont's
rash attempt on Lorraine, and renounces
all quarrel on that account against Charles of
Burgundy."</p>

<p>For once Margaret miscalculated the tractability
of her father's temper. René positively started,
coloured, and stammered with passion, as he interrupted
her&mdash;"<i>Only</i> disown&mdash;<i>only</i> relinquish&mdash;<i>only</i>
renounce the cause of my grandchild, the son
of my dear Yolande&mdash;his rightful claims on his
mother's inheritance!&mdash;Margaret, I am ashamed
for thee. Thy pride is an excuse for thy evil
temper but what is pride worth which can stoop
to commit an act of dishonourable meanness? To
desert, nay, disown, my own flesh and blood, because
the youth is a bold knight under shield, and
disposed to battle for his right&mdash;I were worthy
that harp and horn rung out shame on me, should
I listen to thee."</p>

<p>Margaret was overcome in some measure by
the old man's unexpected opposition. She endeavoured,
however, to show that there was no
occasion, in point of honour, why René should
engage in the cause of a wild adventurer, whose
right, be it good be it bad, was only upheld by
some petty and underhand supplies of money
from France, and the countenance of a few of the
restless banditti who inhabit the borders of all
nations. But ere René could answer, voices, raised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
to an unusual pitch, were heard in the antechamber,
the door of which was flung open by an armed
knight, covered with dust, who exhibited all the
marks of a long journey.</p>

<p>"Here I am," he said, "father of my mother&mdash;behold
your grandson&mdash;Ferrand de Vaudemont;
the son of your lost Yolande kneels at your feet,
and implores a blessing on him and his enterprise."</p>

<p>"Thou hast it," replied René, "and may it
prosper with thee, gallant youth, image of thy
sainted mother&mdash;my blessings, my prayers, my
hopes, go with you!"</p>

<p>"And you, fair aunt of England," said the
young knight, addressing Margaret, "you who are
yourself dispossessed by traitors, will you not own
the cause of a kinsman who is struggling for his
inheritance?"</p>

<p>"I wish all good to your person, fair nephew,"
answered the Queen of England, "although your
features are strange to me. But to advise this old
man to adopt your cause, when it is desperate in
the eyes of all wise men, were impious madness."</p>

<p>"Is my cause then so desperate?" said Ferrand.
"Forgive me if I was not aware of it. And does
my aunt Margaret say this, whose strength of
mind supported Lancaster so long, after the spirits
of her warriors had been quelled by defeat? What&mdash;forgive
me, for my cause must be pleaded&mdash;what
would you have said had my mother Yolande
been capable to advise her father to disown your
own Edward, had God permitted him to reach
Provence in safety?"</p>

<p>"Edward," said Margaret, weeping as she spoke,
"was incapable of desiring his friends to espouse
a quarrel that was irremediable. His, too, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
a cause for which mighty princes and peers laid
lance in rest."</p>

<p>"Yet Heaven blessed it not&mdash;" said Vaudemont.</p>

<p>"Thine," continued Margaret, "is but embraced
by the robber nobles of Germany, the upstart
burghers of the Rhine cities, the paltry and clownish
Confederates of the Cantons."</p>

<p>"But Heaven <i>has blessed it</i>," replied Vaudemont.
"Know, proud woman, that I come to interrupt
your treacherous intrigues; no petty adventurer,
subsisting and maintaining warfare by sleight
rather than force, but a conqueror from a bloody
field of battle, in which Heaven has tamed the
pride of the tyrant of Burgundy."</p>

<p>"It is false!" said the Queen, starting. "I
believe it not."</p>

<p>"It is true," said De Vaudemont, "as true as
heaven is above us.&mdash;It is four days since I left
the field of Granson (<a href="#ednote_d" name="enanchor_d" id="enanchor_d" ><i>d</i></a>), heaped with Burgundy's
mercenaries&mdash;his wealth, his jewels, his plate,
his magnificent decorations, the prize of the poor
Swiss, who scarce can tell their value. Know
you this, Queen Margaret?" continued the young
soldier, showing the well-known jewel which
decorated the Duke's Order of the Golden Fleece;
"think you not the lion was closely hunted when
he left such trophies as these behind him?"</p>

<p>Margaret looked, with dazzled eyes and bewildered
thoughts, upon a token which confirmed the
Duke's defeat, and the extinction of her last
hopes. Her father, on the contrary, was struck
with the heroism of the young warrior, a quality
which, except as it existed in his daughter Margaret,
had, he feared, taken leave of his family.
Admiring in his heart the youth who exposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
himself to danger for the meed of praise, almost as
much as he did the poets by whom the warrior's
fame is rendered immortal, he hugged his grandson
to his bosom, bidding him "gird on his sword
in strength," and assuring him, if money could
advance his affairs, he, King René, could command
ten thousand crowns, any part, or the whole of
which, was at Ferrand's command; thus giving
proof of what had been said of him, that his head
was incapable of containing two ideas at the same
time.</p>

<p>We return to Arthur, who, with the Queen of
England's secretary, Mordaunt, had been not a
little surprised by the entrance of the Count de
Vaudemont, calling himself Duke of Lorraine,
into the anteroom, in which they kept a kind of
guard, followed by a tall strong Swiss, with a
huge halberd over his shoulder. The prince naming
himself, Arthur did not think it becoming to
oppose his entrance to the presence of his grandfather
and aunt, especially as it was obvious that
his opposition must have created an affray. In
the huge staring halberdier, who had sense enough
to remain in the anteroom, Arthur was not a little
surprised to recognise Sigismund Biederman, who,
after staring wildly at him for a moment, like a
dog which suddenly recognises a favourite, rushed
up to the young Englishman with a wild cry of
gladness, and in hurried accents told him how
happy he was to meet with him, and that he had
matters of importance to tell him. It was at no
time easy for Sigismund to arrange his ideas, and
now they were altogether confused, by the triumphant
joy which he expressed for the recent victory
of his countrymen over the Duke of Burgundy;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
and it was with wonder that Arthur heard his
confused and rude but faithful tale.</p>

<p>"Look you, King Arthur, the Duke had come
up with his huge army as far as Granson, which
is near the outlet of the great lake of Neufchatel.
There were five or six hundred Confederates in the
place, and they held it till provisions failed, and
then you know they were forced to give it over.
But though hunger is hard to bear, they had better
have borne it a day or two longer, for the butcher
Charles hung them all up by the neck, upon trees
round the place,&mdash;and there was no swallowing
for them, you know, after such usage as that.
Meanwhile all was busy on our hills, and every
man that had a sword or lance accoutred himself
with it. We met at Neufchatel, and some Germans
joined us with the noble Duke of Lorraine.
Ah, King Arthur, there is a leader!&mdash;we all think
him second but to Rudolph of Donnerhugel&mdash;you
saw him even now&mdash;it was he that went
into that room&mdash;and you saw him before,&mdash;it is
he that was the Blue Knight of Bâle; but we
called him Laurenz then, for Rudolph said his
presence among us must not be known to our
father, and I did not know myself at that time
who he really was. Well, when we came to Neufchatel
we were a goodly company; we were fifteen
thousand stout Confederates, and of others, Germans
and Lorraine men, I will warrant you five
thousand more. We heard that the Burgundian
was sixty thousand in the field; but we heard, at
the same time, that Charles had hung up our
brethren like dogs, and the man was not among
us&mdash;among the Confederates, I mean&mdash;who would
stay to count heads, when the question was to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
avenge them. I would you could have heard the
roar of fifteen thousand Swiss demanding to be led
against the butcher of their brethren! My father
himself, who, you know, is usually so eager for
peace, now gave the first voice for battle; so, in
the grey of the morning, we descended the lake
towards Granson, with tears in our eyes and weapons
in our hands, determined to have death or
vengeance. We came to a sort of strait, between
Vauxmoreux and the lake; there were horse on
the level ground between the mountain and the
lake, and a large body of infantry on the side of
the hill. The Duke of Lorraine and his followers
engaged the horse, while we climbed the hill to
dispossess the infantry. It was with us the affair
of a moment. Every man of us was at home
among the crags, and Charles's men were stuck
among them as thou wert, Arthur, when thou
didst first come to Geierstein. But there were no
kind maidens to lend them their hands to help
them down. No, no&mdash;There were pikes, clubs,
and halberds, many a one, to dash and thrust them
from places where they could hardly keep their
feet had there been no one to disturb them. So
the horsemen, pushed by the Lorrainers, and seeing
us upon their flanks, fled as fast as their horses
could carry them. Then we drew together again
on a fair field, which is <i>buon campagna</i>, as the
Italian says, where the hills retire from the lake.
But lo you, we had scarce arrayed our ranks, when
we heard such a din and clash of instruments,
such a trample of their great horses, such a shouting
and crying of men, as if all the soldiers, and
all the minstrels in France and Germany, were
striving which should make the loudest noise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
Then there was a huge cloud of dust approaching
us, and we began to see we must do or die, for
this was Charles and his whole army come to
support his vanguard. A blast from the mountain
dispersed the dust, for they had halted to prepare
for battle. Oh, good Arthur! you would have
given ten years of life but to have seen the sight.
There were thousands of horse all in complete
array, glancing against the sun, and hundreds of
knights with crowns of gold and silver on their
helmets, and thick masses of spears on foot, and
cannon, as they call them. I did not know what
things they were, which they drew on heavily
with bullocks and placed before their army, but I
knew more of them before the morning was over.
Well, we were ordered to draw up in a hollow
square, as we are taught at exercise, and before we
pushed forwards we were commanded, as is the
godly rule and guise of our warfare, to kneel down
and pray to God, Our Lady, and the blessed saints;
and we afterwards learned that Charles, in his
arrogance, thought we asked for mercy&mdash;Ha! ha!
ha! a proper jest. If my father once knelt to
him, it was for the sake of Christian blood and
godly peace; but on the field of battle Arnold
Biederman would not have knelt to him and his
whole chivalry, though he had stood alone with
his sons on that field. Well, but Charles, supposing
we asked grace, was determined to show
us that we had asked it at a graceless face, for he
cried, 'Fire my cannon on the coward slaves; it
is all the mercy they have to expect from me!'&mdash;Bang&mdash;bang&mdash;bang&mdash;off
went the things I told
you of, like thunder and lightning, and some mischief
they did, but the less that we were kneeling;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
and the saints doubtless gave the huge balls a
hoist over the heads of those who were asking
grace from them, but from no mortal creatures.
So we had the signal to rise and rush on, and I
promise you there were no sluggards. Every man
felt ten men's strength. My halberd is no child's
toy&mdash;if you have forgotten it, there it is&mdash;and
yet it trembled in my grasp as if it had been a
willow wand to drive cows with. On we went,
when suddenly the cannon were silent, and the
earth shook with another and continued growl and
battering, like thunder under ground. It was the
men-at-arms rushing to charge us. But our leaders
knew their trade, and had seen such a sight before&mdash;it
was, Halt, halt&mdash;kneel down in the front&mdash;stoop
in the second rank&mdash;close shoulder to
shoulder like brethren, lean all spears forward and
receive them like an iron wall! On they rushed,
and there was a rending of lances that would have
served the Unterwalden old women with splinters
of firewood for a twelvemonth. Down went armed
horse&mdash;down went accoutred knight&mdash;down went
banner and bannerman&mdash;down went peaked boot
and crowned helmet, and of those who fell not a
man escaped with life. So they drew off in confusion,
and were getting in order to charge again,
when the noble Duke Ferrand and his horsemen
dashed at them in their own way, and we moved
onward to support him. Thus on we pressed, and
the foot hardly waited for us, seeing their cavalry
so handled. Then if you had seen the dust and
heard the blows! the noise of a hundred thousand
thrashers, the flight of the chaff which they
drive about, would be but a type of it. On my
word, I almost thought it shame to dash about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
my halberd, the rout was so helplessly piteous.
Hundreds were slain unresisting, and the whole
army was in complete flight."</p>

<p>"My father&mdash;my father!" exclaimed Arthur.
"In such a rout, what can have become of him?"</p>

<p>"He escaped safely," said the Swiss; "fled
with Charles."</p>

<p>"It must have been a bloody field ere he fled,"
replied the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Nay," answered Sigismund, "he took no part
in the fight, but merely remained by Charles; and
prisoners said it was well for us, for that he is
a man of great counsel and action in the wars.
And as to flying, a man in such a matter must go
back if he cannot press forward, and there is no
shame in it, especially if you be not engaged in
your own person."</p>

<p>As he spoke thus, their conversation was interrupted
by Mordaunt, with "Hush, hush&mdash;the
King and Queen come forth."</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" said Sigismund, in some
alarm. "I care not for the Duke of Lorraine;
but what am I to do when kings and queens
enter?"</p>

<p>"Do nothing but rise, unbonnet yourself, and be
silent."</p>

<p>Sigismund did as he was directed.</p>

<p>King René came forth arm in arm with his
grandson; and Margaret followed, with deep disappointment
and vexation on her brow. She
signed to Arthur as she passed, and said to him&mdash;"Make
thyself master of the truth of this most
unexpected news, and bring the particulars to me.
Mordaunt will introduce thee."</p>

<p>She then cast a look on the young Swiss, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
replied courteously to his awkward salutation.
The royal party then left the room, René bent on
carrying his grandson to the sporting-party, which
had been interrupted, and Margaret to seek the
solitude of her private apartment, and await the
confirmation of what she regarded as evil tidings.</p>

<p>They were no sooner passed than Sigismund
observed,&mdash;"And so that is a King and Queen!&mdash;Peste!
the King looks somewhat like old Jacomo,
the violer, that used to scrape on the fiddle to us
when he came to Geierstein in his rounds. But
the Queen is a stately creature. The chief cow of
the herd, who carries the bouquets and garlands,
and leads the rest to the chalet, has not a statelier
pace. And how deftly you approached her and
spoke to her! I could not have done it with
so much grace&mdash;But it is like that you have
served apprentice to the court trade?"</p>

<p>"Leave that for the present, good Sigismund,"
answered Arthur, "and tell me more of this
battle."</p>

<p>"By St. Mary, but I must have some victuals
and drink first," said Sigismund, "if your credit
in this fine place reaches so far."</p>

<p>"Doubt it not, Sigismund," said Arthur; and,
by the intervention of Mordaunt, he easily procured,
in a more retired apartment, a collation and
wine, to which the young Biederman did great
honour, smacking his lips with much gusto after
the delicious wines, to which, in spite of his
father's ascetic precepts, his palate was beginning
to be considerably formed and habituated. When
he found himself alone with a flask of <i>côté roti</i> and
a biscuit, and his friend Arthur, he was easily led
to continue his tale of conquest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p>

<p>"Well&mdash;where was I?&mdash;Oh, where we broke
their infantry&mdash;well&mdash;they never rallied, and
fell into greater confusion at every step&mdash;and we
might have slaughtered one half of them, had we
not stopped to examine Charles's camp. Mercy
on us, Arthur, what a sight was there! Every
pavilion was full of rich clothes, splendid armour,
and great dishes and flagons, which some men
said were of silver; but I knew there was not so
much silver in the world, and was sure they must
be of pewter, rarely burnished. Here there were
hosts of laced lackeys, and grooms, and pages, and
as many attendants as there were soldiers in the
army; and thousands, for what I knew, of pretty
maidens. By the same token, both menials and
maidens placed themselves at the disposal of the
victors; but I promise you that my father was
right severe on any who would abuse the rights of
war. But some of our young men did not mind
him, till he taught them obedience with the staff
of his halberd. Well, Arthur, there was fine
plundering, for the Germans and French that were
with us rifled everything, and some of our men
followed the example&mdash;it is very catching&mdash;So I
got into Charles's own pavilion, where Rudolph
and some of his people were trying to keep out
every one, that he might have the spoiling of it
himself, I think; but neither he, nor any Bernese
of them all, dared lay truncheon over my pate; so
I entered, and saw them putting piles of pewter-trenchers,
so clean as to look like silver, into
chests and trunks. I pressed through them into
the inner place, and there was Charles's pallet-bed&mdash;I
will do him justice, it was the only hard one
in his camp&mdash;and there were fine sparkling stones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
and pebbles lying about among gauntlets, boots,
vambraces, and suchlike gear&mdash;So I thought of
your father and you, and looked for something,
when what should I see but my old friend here"
(here he drew Queen Margaret's necklace from his
bosom), "which I knew, because you remember I
recovered it from the Scharfgerichter at Brisach.&mdash;'Oho!
you pretty sparklers,' said I, 'you shall be
Burgundian no longer, but go back to my honest
English friends,' and therefore"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is of immense value," said Arthur, "and
belongs not to my father or to me, but to the Queen
you saw but now."</p>

<p>"And she will become it rarely," answered
Sigismund. "Were she but a score, or a score
and a half years younger, she were a gallant wife
for a Swiss landholder. I would warrant her to
keep his household in high order."</p>

<p>"She will reward thee liberally for recovering
her property," said Arthur, scarce suppressing a
smile at the idea of the proud Margaret becoming
the housewife of a Swiss shepherd.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;reward!" said the Swiss. "Bethink
thee I am Sigismund Biederman, the son of the
Landamman of Unterwalden&mdash;I am not a base
lanzknecht, to be paid for courtesy with piastres.
Let her grant me a kind word of thanks, or the
matter of a kiss, and I am well contented."</p>

<p>"A kiss of her hand, perhaps," said Arthur,
again smiling at his friend's simplicity.</p>

<p>"Umph, the hand! Well, it may do for a
queen of some fifty years and odd, but would be
poor homage to a Queen of May."</p>

<p>Arthur here brought back the youth to the subject
of his battle, and learned that the slaughter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
of the Duke's forces in the flight had been in no
degree equal to the importance of the action.</p>

<p>"Many rode off on horseback," said Sigismund;
"and our German <i>reiters</i> flew on the spoil, when
they should have followed the chase. And besides,
to speak truth, Charles's camp delayed our
very selves in the pursuit; but had we gone half
a mile farther, and seen our friends hanging on
trees, not a Confederate would have stopped from the
chase while he had limbs to carry him in pursuit."</p>

<p>"And what has become of the Duke?"</p>

<p>"Charles has retreated into Burgundy, like a
boar who has felt the touch of the spear, and is
more enraged than hurt; but is, they say, sad and
sulky. Others report that he has collected all his
scattered army, and immense forces besides, and
has screwed his subjects to give him money, so
that we may expect another brush. But all Switzerland
will join us after such a victory."</p>

<p>"And my father is with him?" said Arthur.</p>

<p>"Truly he is, and has in a right godly manner
tried to set afoot a treaty of peace with my own
father. But it will scarce succeed. Charles is as
mad as ever; and our people are right proud of our
victory, and so they well may. Nevertheless, my
father forever preaches that such victories, and
such heaps of wealth, will change our ancient
manners, and that the ploughman will leave his
labour to turn soldier. He says much about it;
but why money, choice meat and wine, and fine
clothing should do so much harm, I cannot bring
my poor brains to see&mdash;And many better heads
than mine are as much puzzled.&mdash;Here's to you,
friend Arthur!&mdash;This is choice liquor!"</p>

<p>"And what brings you and your general, Prince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Ferrand, post to Nancy?" said the young Englishman.</p>

<p>"Faith, you are yourself the cause of our
journey."</p>

<p>"I the cause?" said Arthur.&mdash;"Why, how
could that be?"</p>

<p>"Why, it is said you and Queen Margaret are
urging this old fiddling King René to yield up his
territories to Charles, and to disown Ferrand in
his claim upon Lorraine. And the Duke of Lorraine
sent a man that you know well&mdash;that is,
you do not know <i>him</i>, but you know some of his
family, and he knows more of you than you wot&mdash;to
put a spoke in your wheel, and prevent your
getting for Charles the county of Provence, or preventing
Ferrand being troubled or traversed in his
natural rights over Lorraine."</p>

<p>"On my word, Sigismund, I cannot comprehend
you," said Arthur.</p>

<p>"Well," replied the Swiss, "my lot is a hard
one. All our house say that I can comprehend
nothing, and I shall be next told that nobody can
comprehend me.&mdash;Well, in plain language, I
mean my uncle, Count Albert, as he calls himself,
of Geierstein&mdash;my father's brother."</p>

<p>"Anne of Geierstein's father!" echoed Arthur.</p>

<p>"Ay, truly; I thought we should find some
mark to make you know him by."</p>

<p>"But I never saw him."</p>

<p>"Ay, but you have, though&mdash;An able man he
is, and knows more of every man's business than
the man does himself. Oh! it was not for nothing
that he married the daughter of a Salamander!"</p>

<p>"Pshaw, Sigismund, how can you believe that
nonsense?" answered Arthur.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span></p>

<p>"Rudolph told me you were as much bewildered
as I was that night at Graffs-lust," answered the
Swiss.</p>

<p>"If I were so, I was the greater ass for my
pains," answered Arthur.</p>

<p>"Well, but this uncle of mine has got some of
the old conjuring books from the library at Arnheim,
and they say he can pass from place to place
with more than mortal speed; and that he is
helped in his designs by mightier counsellors than
mere men. Always, however, though so able and
highly endowed, his gifts, whether coming from a
lawful or unlawful quarter, bring him no abiding
advantage. He is eternally plunged into strife
and danger."</p>

<p>"I know few particulars of his life," said
Arthur, disguising as much as he could his anxiety
to hear more of him; "but I have heard that he
left Switzerland to join the Emperor."</p>

<p>"True," answered the young Swiss, "and married
the young Baroness of Arnheim,&mdash;but afterwards
he incurred my namesake's imperial displeasure,
and not less that of the Duke of Austria. They
say you cannot live in Rome and strive with the
Pope; so my uncle thought it best to cross the
Rhine, and betake himself to Charles's court, who
willingly received noblemen from all countries, so
that they had good sounding names, with the title
of Count, Marquis, Baron, or suchlike, to march
in front of them. So my uncle was most kindly
received; but within this year or two all this
friendship has been broken up. Uncle Albert
obtained a great lead in some mysterious societies,
of which Charles disapproved, and set so hard at
my poor uncle, that he was fain to take orders and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
shave his hair, rather than lose his head. But
though he cut off his hair, his brain remains as
busy as ever; and although the Duke suffered him
to be at large, yet he found him so often in his
way, that all men believed he waited but an
excuse for seizing upon him and putting him to
death. But my uncle persists that he fears not
Charles; and that, Duke as he is, Charles has more
occasion to be afraid of him.&mdash;And so you saw
how boldly he played his part at La Ferette."</p>

<p>"By St. George of Windsor!" exclaimed Arthur,
"the Black Priest of St. Paul's?"</p>

<p>"Oho! you understand me now. Well, he took
it upon him that Charles would not dare to punish
him for his share in De Hagenbach's death; and
no more did he, although uncle Albert sat and
voted in the Estates of Burgundy, and stirred them
up all he could to refuse giving Charles the money
he asked of them. But when the Swiss war broke
out, uncle Albert became assured his being a
clergyman would be no longer his protection, and
that the Duke intended to have him accused of
corresponding with his brother and countrymen;
and so he appeared suddenly in Ferrand's camp at
Neufchatel, and sent a message to Charles that he
renounced his allegiance, and bid him defiance."</p>

<p>"A singular story of an active and versatile
man," said the young Englishman.</p>

<p>"Oh, you may seek the world for a man like
uncle Albert. Then he knows everything; and he
told Duke Ferrand what you were about here, and
offered to go and bring more certain information&mdash;ay,
though he left the Swiss camp but five or six
days before the battle, and the distance between
Arles and Neufchatel be four hundred miles complete,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
yet he met him on his return, when Duke
Ferrand, with me to show him the way, was hastening
hitherward, having set off from the very
field of battle."</p>

<p>"Met him!" said Arthur&mdash;"Met whom?&mdash;Met
the Black Priest of St. Paul's?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I mean so," replied Sigismund; "but he
was habited as a Carmelite monk."</p>

<p>"A Carmelite!" said Arthur, a sudden light
flashing on him; "and I was so blind as to recommend
his services to the Queen! I remember well
that he kept his face much concealed in his cowl&mdash;and
I, foolish beast, to fall so grossly into the
snare!&mdash;And yet perhaps it is as well the transaction
was interrupted, since I fear, if carried successfully
through, all must have been disconcerted
by this astounding defeat."</p>

<p>Their conversation had thus far proceeded, when
Mordaunt appearing, summoned Arthur to his
royal mistress's apartment. In that gay palace,
a gloomy room, whose windows looked upon some
part of the ruins of the Roman edifice, but excluded
every other object, save broken walls and tottering
columns, was the retreat which Margaret had
chosen for her own. She received Albert with a
kindness more touching that it was the inmate of
so proud and fiery a disposition,&mdash;of a heart assailed
with many woes, and feeling them severely.</p>

<p>"Alas, poor Arthur!" she said, "thy life begins
where thy father's threatens to end, in useless
labour to save a sinking vessel. The rushing leak
pours in its waters faster than human force can
lighten or discharge. All&mdash;all goes wrong, when
our unhappy cause becomes connected with it&mdash;Strength
becomes weakness, wisdom folly, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
valour cowardice. The Duke of Burgundy, hitherto
victorious in all his bold undertakings, has but to
entertain the momentary thought of yielding succour
to Lancaster, and behold his sword is broken
by a peasant's flail; and his disciplined army,
held to be the finest in the world, flies like chaff
before the wind; while their spoils are divided by
renegade German hirelings, and barbarous Alpine
shepherds!&mdash;What more hast thou learned of this
strange tale?"</p>

<p>"Little, madam, but what you have heard. The
worst additions are, that the battle was shamefully
cowardlike, and completely lost, with every
advantage to have won it&mdash;the best, that the
Burgundian army has been rather dispersed than
destroyed, and that the Duke himself has escaped,
and is rallying his forces in Upper Burgundy."</p>

<p>"To sustain a new defeat, or engage in a protracted
and doubtful contest, fatal to his reputation
as defeat itself. Where is thy father?"</p>

<p>"With the Duke, madam, as I have been informed,"
replied Arthur.</p>

<p>"Hie to him, and say I charge him to look after
his own safety, and care no further for my interests.
This last blow has sunk me&mdash;I am without
an ally, without a friend, without treasure"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not so, madam," replied Arthur. "One piece
of good fortune has brought back to your Grace
this inestimable relic of your fortunes."&mdash;And,
producing the precious necklace, he gave the history
of its recovery.</p>

<p>"I rejoice at the chance which has restored these
diamonds," said the Queen, "that in point of
gratitude, at least, I may not be utterly bankrupt.
Carry them to your father&mdash;tell him my schemes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
are over&mdash;and my heart, which so long clung to
hope, is broken at last.&mdash;Tell him the trinkets are
his own, and to his own use let him apply them.
They will but poorly repay the noble earldom of
Oxford, lost in the cause of her who sends them."</p>

<p>"Royal madam," said the youth, "be assured
my father would sooner live by service as a
<i>schwarzreiter</i>, than become a burden on your
misfortunes."</p>

<p>"He never yet disobeyed command of mine,"
said Margaret; "and this is the last I will lay
upon him. If he is too rich or too proud to benefit
by his Queen's behest, he will find enough of
poor Lancastrians who have fewer means or fewer
scruples."</p>

<p>"There is yet a circumstance I have to communicate,"
said Arthur, and recounted the history
of Albert of Geierstein, and the disguise of a
Carmelite monk.</p>

<p>"Are you such a fool," answered the Queen, "as
to suppose this man has any supernatural powers
to aid him in his ambitious projects and his hasty
journeys?"</p>

<p>"No, madam&mdash;but it is whispered that the
Count Albert of Geierstein, or this Black Priest of
St. Paul's, is a chief amongst the Secret Societies
of Germany, which even princes dread whilst they
hate them; for the man that can command a hundred
daggers must be feared even by those who
rule thousands of swords."</p>

<p>"Can this person," said the Queen, "being now
a Churchman, retain authority amongst those who
deal in life and death? It is contrary to the
canons."</p>

<p>"It would seem so, royal madam; but everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
in these dark institutions differs from what
is practised in the light of day. Prelates are
often heads of a Vehmique bench, and the Archbishop
of Cologne exercises the dreadful office of
their chief as Duke of Westphalia, the principal
region in which these societies flourish.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
 Such
privileges attach to the secret influence of the
chiefs of this dark association, as may well seem
supernatural to those who are unapprised of circumstances
of which men shun to speak in plain
terms."</p>

<p>"Let him be wizard or assassin," said the Queen,
"I thank him for having contributed to interrupt
my plan of the old man's cession of Provence,
which, as events stand, would have stripped René
of his dominions, without furthering our plan of
invading England.&mdash;Once more, be stirring with
the dawn, and bend thy way back to thy father, and
charge him to care for himself and think no more
of me. Bretagne, where the heir of Lancaster
resides, will be the safest place of refuge for its
bravest followers. Along the Rhine, the Invisible
Tribunal, it would seem, haunts both shores, and
to be innocent of ill is no security; even here the
proposed treaty with Burgundy may take air, and
the Provençaux carry daggers as well as crooks
and pipes. But I hear the horses fast returning
from the hawking-party, and the silly old man,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
forgetting all the eventful proceedings of the day,
whistling as he ascends the steps. Well, we will
soon part, and my removal will be, I think, a
relief to him. Prepare for banquet and ball, for
noise and nonsense&mdash;above all, to bid adieu to
Aix with morning dawn."</p>

<p>Thus dismissed from the Queen's presence,
Arthur's first care was to summon Thiebault to
have all things in readiness for his departure; his
next, to prepare himself for the pleasures of the
evening, not perhaps so heavily affected by the
failure of his negotiation as to be incapable of
consolation in such a scene; for the truth was,
that his mind secretly revolted at the thoughts of
the simple old King being despoiled of his dominions
to further an invasion of England, in which,
whatever interest he might have in his daughter's
rights, there was little chance of success.</p>

<p>If such feelings were censurable, they had their
punishment. Although few knew how completely
the arrival of the Duke of Lorraine, and the intelligence
he brought with him, had disconcerted the
plans of Queen Margaret, it was well known there
had been little love betwixt the Queen and his
mother Yolande; and the young Prince found
himself at the head of a numerous party in the
court of his grandfather, who disliked his aunt's
haughty manners, and were wearied by the unceasing
melancholy of her looks and conversation,
and her undisguised contempt of the frivolities
which passed around her. Ferrand, besides, was
young, handsome, a victor just arrived from a field
of battle, fought gloriously, and gained against all
chances to the contrary. That he was a general
favourite, and excluded Arthur Philipson, as an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
adherent of the unpopular Queen, from the notice
her influence had on a former evening procured
him, was only a natural consequence of their
relative condition. But what somewhat hurt Arthur's
feelings was to see his friend Sigismund the
Simple, as his brethren called him, shining with
the reflected glory of the Duke Ferrand of Lorraine,
who introduced to all the ladies present the gallant
young Swiss as Count Sigismund of Geierstein.
His care had procured for his follower a dress
rather more suitable for such a scene than the
country attire of the count, otherwise Sigismund
Biederman.</p>

<p>For a certain time, whatever of novelty is introduced
into society is pleasing, though it has
nothing else to recommend it. The Swiss were
little known personally out of their own country,
but they were much talked of; it was a recommendation
to be of that country. Sigismund's
manners were blunt&mdash;a mixture of awkwardness
and rudeness, which was termed frankness during
the moment of his favour. He spoke bad French
and worse Italian&mdash;it gave naïveté to all he said.
His limbs were too bulky to be elegant; his
dancing, for Count Sigismund failed not to dance,
was the bounding and gambolling of a young elephant;
yet they were preferred to the handsome
proportions and courtly movements of the youthful
Englishman, even by the black-eyed countess in
whose good graces Arthur had made some progress
on the preceding evening. Arthur, thus thrown
into the shade, felt as Mr. Pepys afterwards did
when he tore his camlet cloak&mdash;the damage was
not great, but it troubled him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the passing evening brought him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
some revenge. There are some works of art the
defects of which are not seen till they are injudiciously
placed in too strong a light, and such was
the case with Sigismund the Simple. The quick-witted
though fantastic Provençaux soon found out
the heaviness of his intellect, and the extent of
his good-nature, and amused themselves at his
expense, by ironical compliments and well-veiled
raillery. It is probable they would have been less
delicate on the subject, had not the Swiss brought
into the dancing-room along with him his eternal
halberd, the size and weight and thickness of
which boded little good to any one whom the
owner might detect in the act of making merry at
his expense. But Sigismund did no further mischief
that night, except that, in achieving a superb
<i>entrechat</i>, he alighted with his whole weight on
the miniature foot of his pretty partner, which he
well-nigh crushed to pieces.</p>

<p>Arthur had hitherto avoided looking towards
Queen Margaret during the course of the evening,
lest he should disturb her thoughts from the channel
in which they were rolling, by seeming to lay
a claim on her protection. But there was something
so whimsical in the awkward physiognomy
of the maladroit Swiss, that he could not help
glancing an eye to the alcove where the Queen's
chair of state was placed, to see if she observed
him. The very first view was such as to rivet his
attention. Margaret's head was reclined on the
chair, her eyes scarcely open, her features drawn
up and pinched, her hands closed with effort. The
English lady of honour who stood behind her&mdash;old,
deaf, and dim-sighted&mdash;had not discovered
anything in her mistress's position more than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
abstracted and indifferent attitude with which the
Queen was wont to be present in body and absent
in mind during the festivities of the Provençal
court. But when Arthur, greatly alarmed, came
behind the seat to press her attention to her mistress,
she exclaimed, after a minute's investigation,
"Mother of Heaven, the Queen is dead!"
And it was so. It seemed that the last fibre of
life, in that fiery and ambitious mind, had, as she
herself prophesied, given way at the same time
with the last thread of political hope.

<p class="i12"><i>Old Poem.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The commotion and shrieks of fear and amazement
which were excited among the ladies of the court
by an event so singular and shocking, had begun
to abate, and the sighs, more serious though less
intrusive, of the few English attendants of the
deceased Queen began to be heard, together with
the groans of old King René, whose emotions were
as acute as they were shortlived. The leeches had
held a busy but unavailing consultation, and the
body that was once a queen's was delivered to the
Priest of St. Sauveur, that beautiful church in
which the spoils of Pagan temples have contributed
to fill up the magnificence of the Christian
edifice. The stately pile was duly lighted up,
and the funeral provided with such splendour as
Aix could supply. The Queen's papers being
examined, it was found that Margaret, by disposing
of jewels and living at small expense, had
realised the means of making a decent provision
for life for her very few English attendants. Her
diamond necklace, described in her last will as in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
the hands of an English merchant named John
Philipson, or his son, or the price thereof, if by
them sold or pledged, she left to the said John
Philipson and his son Arthur Philipson, with a
view to the prosecution of the design which they
had been destined to advance, or, if that should
prove impossible, to their own use and profit.
The charge of her funeral rites was wholly intrusted
to Arthur, called Philipson, with a request
that they should be conducted entirely after the
forms observed in England. This trust was expressed
in an addition to her will, signed the very
day on which she died.</p>

<p>Arthur lost no time in despatching Thiebault
express to his father, with a letter explaining, in
such terms as he knew would be understood, the
tenor of all that had happened since he came to
Aix, and, above all, the death of Queen Margaret.</p>

<p>Finally, he requested directions for his motions,
since the necessary delay occupied by the obsequies
of a person of such eminent rank must detain
him at Aix till he should receive them.</p>

<p>The old King sustained the shock of his daughter's
death so easily, that on the second day after
the event he was engaged in arranging a pompous
procession for the funeral, and composing an elegy,
to be sung to a tune also of his own composing, in
honour of the deceased Queen, who was likened to
the goddesses of heathen mythology, and to Judith,
Deborah, and all the other holy women, not to
mention the saints of the Christian dispensation.
It cannot be concealed that, when the first burst
of grief was over, King René could not help feeling
that Margaret's death cut a political knot which
he might have otherwise found it difficult to untie,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
and permitted him to take open part with his
grandson, so far indeed as to afford him a considerable
share of the contents of the Provençal treasury,
which amounted to no larger sum than ten
thousand crowns. Ferrand having received the
blessing of his grandfather, in a form which his
affairs rendered most important to him, returned
to the resolutes whom he commanded; and with
him, after a most loving farewell to Arthur,
went the stout but simple-minded young Swiss,
Sigismund Biederman.</p>

<p>The little court of Aix were left to their mourning.
King René, for whom ceremonial and show,
whether of a joyful or melancholy character, was
always matter of importance, would willingly
have bestowed on solemnising the obsequies of his
daughter Margaret what remained of his revenue,
but was prevented from doing so, partly by remonstrances
from his ministers, partly by the obstacles
opposed by the young Englishman, who, acting
upon the presumed will of the dead, interfered
to prevent any such fantastic exhibitions being
produced at the obsequies of the Queen as had
disgusted her during her life.</p>

<p>The funeral, therefore, after many days had been
spent in public prayers and acts of devotion, was
solemnised with the mournful magnificence due
to the birth of the deceased, and with which the
Church of Rome so well knows how to affect at
once the eye, ear, and feelings.</p>

<p>Amid the various nobles who assisted on the
solemn occasion, there was one who arrived just
as the tolling of the great bells of St. Sauveur
had announced that the procession was already
on its way to the cathedral. The stranger hastily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
exchanged his travelling-dress for a suit of deep
mourning, which was made after the fashion proper
to England. So attired, he repaired to the cathedral,
where the noble mien of the cavalier imposed
such respect on the attendants that he was permitted
to approach close to the side of the bier;
and it was across the coffin of the Queen for whom
he had acted and suffered so much that the gallant
Earl of Oxford exchanged a melancholy glance
with his son. The assistants, especially the English
servants of Margaret, gazed on them both with
respect and wonder, and the elder cavalier, in particular,
seemed to them no unapt representative
of the faithful subjects of England, paying their
last duty at the tomb of her who had so long
swayed the sceptre, if not faultlessly, yet always
with a bold and resolved hand.</p>

<p>The last sound of the solemn dirge had died
away, and almost all the funeral attendants had
retired, when the father and son still lingered in
mournful silence beside the remains of their sovereign.
The clergy at length approached, and intimated
they were about to conclude the last duties,
by removing the body, which had been lately
occupied and animated by so haughty and restless
a spirit, to the dust, darkness, and silence of the
vault where the long-descended Counts of Provence
awaited dissolution. Six priests raised the bier
on their shoulders, others bore huge waxen torches
before and behind the body, as they carried it
down a private staircase which yawned in the floor
to admit their descent. The last notes of the
requiem, in which the churchmen joined, had died
away along the high and fretted arches of the
cathedral, the last flash of light which arose from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
the mouth of the vault had glimmered and disappeared,
when the Earl of Oxford, taking his son
by the arm, led him in silence forth into a small
cloistered court behind the building, where they
found themselves alone. They were silent for a
few minutes, for both, and particularly the father,
were deeply affected. At length the Earl spoke.</p>

<p>"And this, then, is her end," said he. "Here,
royal lady, all that we have planned and pledged
life upon falls to pieces with thy dissolution!
The heart of resolution, the head of policy is gone;
and what avails it that the limbs of the enterprise
still have motion and life? Alas, Margaret of
Anjou! may Heaven reward thy virtues, and absolve
thee from the consequence of thine errors!
Both belonged to thy station, and, if thou didst
hoist too high a sail in prosperity, never lived
there princess who defied more proudly the storms
of adversity, or bore up against them with such
dauntless nobility of determination. With this
event the drama has closed, and our parts, my
son, are ended."</p>

<p>"We bear arms, then, against the infidels, my
lord?" said Arthur, with a sigh that was, however,
hardly audible.</p>

<p>"Not," answered the Earl, "until I learn that
Henry of Richmond, the undoubted heir of the
House of Lancaster, has no occasion for my services.
In these jewels, of which you wrote me,
so strangely lost and recovered, I may be able to
supply him with resources more needful than
either your services or mine. But I return no
more to the camp of the Duke of Burgundy; for
in him there is no help."</p>

<p>"Can it be possible that the power of so great a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
sovereign has been overthrown in one fatal battle?"
said Arthur.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i315" id="i315"></a>
<img src="images/i-315.jpg" width="372" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE FUNERAL OF THE QUEEN.<br />

</div>
<p>"By no means," replied his father. "The loss
at Granson was very great; but to the strength of
Burgundy it is but a scratch on the shoulders of
a giant. It is the spirit of Charles himself, his
wisdom at least, and his foresight, which have
given way under the mortification of a defeat by
such as he accounted inconsiderable enemies, and
expected to have trampled down with a few squadrons
of his men-at-arms. Then his temper is
become froward, peevish, and arbitrary, devoted to
those who flatter and, as there is too much reason
to believe, betray him, and suspicious of those
counsellors who give him wholesome advice. Even
I have had my share of distrust. Thou knowest I
refused to bear arms against our late hosts the
Swiss; and he saw in that no reason for rejecting
my attendance on his march. But since the defeat
of Granson, I have observed a strong and sudden
change, owing, perhaps, in some degree to the
insinuations of Campo-basso, and not a little to
the injured pride of the Duke, who was unwilling
that an indifferent person in my situation, and
thinking as I do, should witness the disgrace of
his arms. He spoke in my hearing of lukewarm
friends, cold-blooded neutrals,&mdash;of those who, not
being with him, must be against him. I tell
thee, Arthur de Vere, the Duke has said that
which touched my honour so nearly, that nothing
but the commands of Queen Margaret, and the
interests of the House of Lancaster, could have
made me remain in his camp. That is over&mdash;My
royal mistress has no more occasion for my poor
services&mdash;the Duke can spare no aid to our cause&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
if he could, we can no longer dispose of the
only bribe which might have induced him to afford
us succours. The power of seconding his views on
Provence is buried with Margaret of Anjou."</p>

<p>"What, then, is your purpose?" demanded his son.</p>

<p>"I propose," said Oxford, "to wait at the court
of King René until I can hear from the Earl of
Richmond, as we must still call him. I am aware
that banished men are rarely welcome at the court
of a foreign prince; but I have been the faithful
follower of his daughter Margaret. I only propose
to reside in disguise, and desire neither notice nor
maintenance; so methinks King René will not
refuse to permit me to breathe the air of his
dominions, until I learn in what direction fortune
or duty shall call me."</p>

<p>"Be assured he will not," answered Arthur.
"René is incapable of a base or ignoble thought;
and if he could despise trifles as he detests dishonour,
he might be ranked high in the list of
monarchs."</p>

<p>This resolution being adopted, the son presented
his father at King René's court, whom he privately
made acquainted that he was a man of quality,
and a distinguished Lancastrian. The good King
would in his heart have preferred a guest of lighter
accomplishments and gayer temper to Oxford, a
statesman and a soldier of melancholy and grave
habits. The Earl was conscious of this, and
seldom troubled his benevolent and light-hearted
host with his presence. He had, however, an
opportunity of rendering the old King a favour of
peculiar value. This was in conducting an important
treaty betwixt René and Louis XI. of France,
his nephew. Upon that crafty monarch René
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
finally settled his principality; for the necessity of
extricating his affairs by such a measure was now apparent
even to himself, every thought of favouring
Charles of Burgundy in the arrangement having
died with Queen Margaret. The policy and wisdom
of the English Earl, who was intrusted with
almost the sole charge of this secret and delicate
measure, were of the utmost advantage to good
King René, who was freed from personal and pecuniary
vexations, and enabled to go piping and
tabouring to his grave. Louis did not fail to
propitiate the plenipotentiary, by throwing out
distant hopes of aid to the efforts of the Lancastrian
party in England. A faint and insecure negotiation
was entered into upon the subject; and these
affairs, which rendered two journeys to Paris necessary
on the part of Oxford and his son, in the
spring and summer of the year 1476, occupied them
until that year was half spent.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the wars of the Duke of Burgundy
with the Swiss Cantons and Count Ferrand
of Lorraine continued to rage. Before midsummer
1476, Charles had assembled a new army of at least
sixty thousand men, supported by one hundred and
fifty pieces of cannon, for the purpose of invading
Switzerland, where the warlike mountaineers easily
levied a host of thirty thousand Switzers, now
accounted almost invincible, and called upon their
confederates, the Free Cities on the Rhine, to support
them with a powerful body of cavalry. The
first efforts of Charles were successful. He overran
the Pays de Vaud, and recovered most of the places
which he had lost after the defeat at Granson.
But instead of attempting to secure a well-defended
frontier, or, what would have been still more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
politic, to achieve a peace upon equitable terms
with his redoubtable neighbours, this most obstinate
of princes resumed the purpose of penetrating
into the recesses of the Alpine mountains, and
chastising the mountaineers even within their own
strongholds, though experience might have taught
him the danger, nay desperation, of the attempt.
Thus the news received by Oxford and his son,
when they returned to Aix in midsummer, was,
that Duke Charles had advanced to Morat (or
Murten), situated upon a lake of the same name,
at the very entrance of Switzerland. Here report
said that Adrian de Bubenburg, a veteran knight
of Berne, commanded, and maintained the most
obstinate defence, in expectation of the relief
which his countrymen were hastily assembling.</p>

<p>"Alas, my old brother-in-arms!" said the Earl
to his son, on hearing these tidings, "this town
besieged, these assaults repelled, this vicinity of
an enemy's country, this profound lake, these
inaccessible cliffs, threaten a second part of the
tragedy of Granson, more calamitous perhaps than
even the former!"</p>

<p>On the last week of June, the capital of Provence
was agitated by one of those unauthorised yet
generally received rumours which transmit great
events with incredible swiftness, as an apple flung
from hand to hand by a number of people will pass
a given space infinitely faster than if borne by the
most rapid series of expresses. The report announced
a second defeat of the Burgundians, in
terms so exaggerated as induced the Earl of Oxford
to consider the greater part, if not the whole, as
a fabrication.

<p>Sleep did not close the eyes of the Earl of Oxford
or his son; for although the success or defeat of
the Duke of Burgundy could not now be of importance
to their own private or political affairs, yet
the father did not cease to interest himself in the
fate of his former companion-in-arms; and the son,
with the fire of youth, always eager after novelty,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>

expected to find something to advance or thwart
his own progress in every remarkable event which
agitated the world.</p>

<p>Arthur had risen from his bed, and was in the
act of attiring himself, when the tread of a horse
arrested his attention. He had no sooner looked
out of the window, than, exclaiming, "News, my
father, news from the army!" he rushed into the
street, where a cavalier, who appeared to have
ridden very hard, was inquiring for the two
Philipsons, father and son. He had no difficulty
in recognising Colvin, the master of the Burgundian
ordnance. His ghastly look bespoke distress
of mind; his disordered array and broken
armour, which seemed rusted with rain or stained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
with blood, gave the intelligence of some affray
in which he had probably been worsted; and so
exhausted was his gallant steed, that it was with
difficulty the animal could stand upright. The
condition of the rider was not much better. When
he alighted from his horse to greet Arthur, he
reeled so much that he would have fallen without
instant support. His horny eye had lost the
power of speculation; his limbs possessed imperfectly
that of motion, and it was with a half-suffocated
voice that he muttered, "Only fatigue&mdash;want
of rest and of food."</p>

<p>Arthur assisted him into the house, and refreshments
were procured; but he refused all except a
bowl of wine, after tasting which he set it down,
and, looking at the Earl of Oxford with an eye of
the deepest affliction, he ejaculated, "The Duke of
Burgundy!"</p>

<p>"Slain?" replied the Earl. "I trust not!"</p>

<p>"It might have been better if he were," said
the Englishman; "but dishonour has come before
death."</p>

<p>"Defeated, then?" said Oxford.</p>

<p>"So completely and fearfully defeated," answered
the soldier, "that all that I have seen of
loss before was slight in comparison."</p>

<p>"But how, or where?" said the Earl of Oxford.
"You were superior in numbers, as we were
informed."</p>

<p>"Two to one at least," answered Colvin; "and
when I speak of our encounter at this moment, I
could rend my flesh with my teeth for being here
to tell such a tale of shame. We had sat down
for about a week before that paltry town of
Murten, or Morat, or whatever it is called. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
governor, one of those stubborn mountain bears of
Berne, bade us defiance. He would not even condescend
to shut his gates, but, when we summoned
the town, returned for answer, we might enter if
we pleased,&mdash;we should be suitably received. I
would have tried to bring him to reason by a salvo
or two of artillery, but the Duke was too much
irritated to listen to good counsel. Stimulated
by that black traitor, Campo-basso, he deemed it
better to run forward with his whole force upon a
place which, though I could soon have battered it
about their German ears, was yet too strong to be
carried by swords, lances, and hagbuts. We were
beaten off with great loss, and much discouragement
to the soldiers. We then commenced more
regularly, and my batteries would have brought
these mad Switzers to their senses. Walls and
ramparts went down before the lusty cannoneers
of Burgundy; we were well secured also by intrenchments
against those whom we heard of as
approaching to raise the siege. But, on the evening
of the twentieth of this month, we learned
that they were close at hand, and Charles, consulting
only his own bold spirit, advanced to
meet them, relinquishing the advantage of our batteries
and strong position. By his orders, though
against my own judgment, I accompanied him
with twenty good pieces, and the flower of my
people. We broke up on the next morning, and
had not advanced far before we saw the lances and
thick array of halberds and two-handed swords
which crested the mountain. Heaven, too, added
its terrors&mdash;a thunderstorm, with all the fury
of those tempestuous climates, descended on both
armies, but did most annoyance to ours, as our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
troops, especially the Italians, were more sensible
to the torrents of rain which poured down, and the
rivulets which, swelled into torrents, inundated
and disordered our position. The Duke for once
saw it necessary to alter his purpose of instant
battle. He rode up to me, and directed me to
defend with the cannon the retreat which he was
about to commence, adding that he himself would
in person sustain me with the men-at-arms. The
order was given to retreat. But the movement
gave new spirit to an enemy already sufficiently
audacious. The ranks of the Swiss instantly prostrated
themselves in prayer&mdash;a practice on the
field of battle which I have ridiculed&mdash;but I will
do so no more. When, after five minutes, they
sprang again on their feet, and began to advance
rapidly, sounding their horns and crying their
war-cries with all their usual ferocity&mdash;behold,
my lord, the clouds of heaven opened, shedding on
the Confederates the blessed light of the returning
sun, while our ranks were still in the gloom of the
tempest. My men were discouraged. The host
behind them was retreating; the sudden light
thrown on the advancing Switzers showed along
the mountains a profusion of banners, a glancing
of arms, giving to the enemy the appearance of
double the numbers that had hitherto been visible
to us. I exhorted my followers to stand fast, but
in doing so I thought a thought, and spoke a word,
which was a grievous sin. 'Stand fast, my brave
cannoneers!' I said. 'We will presently let them
hear louder thunders, and show them more fatal
lightnings, than their prayers have put down!'
My men shouted. But it was an impious thought,
a blasphemous speech, and evil came after it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
We levelled our guns on the advancing masses as
fairly as cannon were ever pointed&mdash;I can vouch
it, for I laid the Grand Duchess of Burgundy
myself&mdash;Ah, poor Duchess! what rude hands
manage thee now!&mdash;The volley was fired, and,
ere the smoke spread from the muzzles, I could see
many a man and many a banner go down. It was
natural to think such a discharge should have
checked the attack, and whilst the smoke hid the
enemy from us I made every effort again to load
our cannon, and anxiously endeavoured to look
through the mist to discover the state of our
opponents. But ere our smoke was cleared away,
or the cannon again loaded, they came headlong
down on us, horse and foot, old men and boys,
men-at-arms and varlets, charging up to the
muzzle of the guns, and over them, with total
disregard to their lives. My brave fellows were
cut down, pierced through, and overrun, while
they were again loading their pieces, nor do I
believe that a single cannon was fired a second
time."</p>

<p>"And the Duke?" said the Earl of Oxford.
"Did he not support you?"</p>

<p>"Most loyally and bravely," answered Colvin,
"with his own bodyguard of Walloons and Burgundians.
But a thousand Italian mercenaries
went off, and never showed face again. The pass,
too, was cumbered with the artillery, and in
itself narrow, bordering on mountains and cliffs,
a deep lake close beside. In short, it was a place
totally unfit for horsemen to act in. In spite of
the Duke's utmost exertions, and those of the gallant
Flemings who fought around him, all were
borne back in complete disorder. I was on foot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
fighting as I could, without hopes of my life, or
indeed thoughts of saving it, when I saw the guns
taken and my faithful cannoneers slain. But I saw
Duke Charles hard pressed, and took my horse
from my page that held him&mdash;Thou, too, art lost,
my poor orphan boy!&mdash;I could only aid Monseigneur
de la Croye and others to extricate the
Duke. Our retreat became a total rout, and when
we reached our rearguard, which we had left strongly
encamped, the banners of the Switzers were waving
on our batteries, for a large division had made
a circuit through mountain passes known only to
themselves, and attacked our camp, vigorously
seconded by that accursed Adrian de Bubenburg,
who sallied from the beleaguered town, so that
our intrenchments were stormed on both sides at
once.&mdash;I have more to say, but having ridden day
and night to bring you these evil tidings, my
tongue clings to the roof of my mouth, and I feel
that I can speak no more. The rest is all flight
and massacre, disgraceful to every soldier that
shared in it. For my part, I confess my contumelious
self-confidence and insolence to man, as
well as blasphemy to Heaven. If I live, it is but
to hide my disgraced head in a cowl, and expiate
the numerous sins of a licentious life."</p>

<p>With difficulty the broken-minded soldier was
prevailed upon to take some nourishment and
repose, together with an opiate, which was prescribed
by the physician of King René, who recommended
it as necessary to preserve even the
reason of his patient, exhausted by the events of
the battle, and subsequent fatigue.</p>

<p>The Earl of Oxford, dismissing other assistance,
watched alternately with his son at Colvin's bedside.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
Notwithstanding the draught that had been
administered, his repose was far from sound.
Sudden starts, the perspiration which started from
his brow, the distortions of his countenance, and
the manner in which he clenched his fists and
flung about his limbs, showed that in his dreams he
was again encountering the terrors of a desperate
and forlorn combat. This lasted for several hours;
but about noon fatigue and medicine prevailed
over nervous excitation, and the defeated commander
fell into a deep and untroubled repose till
evening. About sunset he awakened, and, after
learning with whom and where he was, he partook
of refreshments, and, without any apparent consciousness
of having told them before, detailed
once more all the particulars of the battle of
Murten.</p>

<p>"It were little wide of truth," he said, "to
calculate that one half of the Duke's army fell by
the sword, or were driven into the lake. Those
who escaped are great part of them scattered, never
again to unite. Such a desperate and irretrievable
rout was never witnessed. We fled like deer,
sheep, or any other timid animals, which only
remain in company because they are afraid to
separate, but never think of order or of defence."</p>

<p>"And the Duke?" said the Earl of Oxford.</p>

<p>"We hurried him with us," said the soldier,
"rather from instinct than loyalty, as men flying
from a conflagration snatch up what they have of
value, without knowing what they are doing.
Knight and knave, officer and soldier, fled in the
same panic, and each blast of the horn of Uri in
our rear added new wings to our flight."</p>

<p>"And the Duke?" repeated Oxford.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<p>"At first he resisted our efforts, and strove to
turn back on the foe; but when the flight became
general he galloped along with us, without a word
spoken or a command issued. At first we thought
his silence and passiveness, so unusual in a temper
so fiery, were fortunate for securing his personal
safety. But when we rode the whole day, without
being able to obtain a word of reply to all our
questions,&mdash;when he sternly refused refreshments
of every kind, though he had tasted no food all
that disastrous day,&mdash;when every variation of his
moody and uncertain temper was sunk into silent
and sullen despair, we took counsel what was to
be done, and it was by the general voice that I
was despatched to entreat that you, for whose
counsels alone Charles has been known to have
had some occasional deference, would come instantly
to his place of retreat, and exert all your
influence to awaken him from this lethargy, which
may otherwise terminate his existence."</p>

<p>"And what remedy can I interpose?" said
Oxford. "You know how he neglected my advice,
when following it might have served my
interest as well as his own. You are aware that
my life was not safe among the miscreants that
surrounded the Duke, and exercised influence over
him."</p>

<p>"Most true," answered Colvin; "but I also
know he is your ancient companion-in-arms, and
it would ill become me to teach the noble Earl of
Oxford what the laws of chivalry require. For
your lordship's safety, every honest man in the
army will give willing security."</p>

<p>"It is for that I care least," said Oxford, indifferently;
"and if indeed my presence can be of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
service to the Duke,&mdash;if I could believe that he
desired it"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"He does&mdash;he does, my lord!" said the faithful
soldier, with tears in his eyes. "We heard
him name your name, as if the words escaped him
in a painful dream."</p>

<p>"I will go to him, such being the case," said
Oxford.&mdash;"I will go instantly. Where did he
purpose to establish his headquarters?"</p>

<p>"He had fixed nothing for himself on that or
other matters; but Monsieur de Contay named La
Rivière, near Salins, in Upper Burgundy, as the
place of his retreat."</p>

<p>"Thither, then, will we, my son, with all haste
of preparation. Thou, Colvin, hadst better remain
here, and see some holy man, to be assoilzied for
thy hasty speech on the battle-field of Morat.
There was offence in it without doubt, but it will
be ill atoned for by quitting a generous master
when he hath most need of your good service; and
it is but an act of cowardice to retreat into the
cloister, till we have no longer active duties to
perform in this world."</p>

<p>"It is true," said Colvin, "that should I leave
the Duke now, perhaps not a man would stay
behind that could stell a cannon properly. The
sight of your lordship cannot but operate favourably
on my noble master, since it has waked the
old soldier in myself. If your lordship can delay
your journey till to-morrow, I will have my
spiritual affairs settled, and my bodily health sufficiently
restored, to be your guide to La Rivière;
and, for the cloister, I will think of it when I
have regained the good name which I have lost
at Murten. But I will have masses said, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
these right powerful, for the souls of my poor
cannoneers."</p>

<p>The proposal of Colvin was adopted, and Oxford,
with his son, attended by Thiebault, spent the day
in preparation, excepting the time necessary to
take formal leave of King René, who seemed to
part with them with regret. In company with
the ordnance officer of the discomfited Duke, they
traversed those parts of Provence, Dauphiné, and
Franche Compté which lie between Aix and the
place to which the Duke of Burgundy had retreated;
but the distance and inconvenience of so
long a route consumed more than a fortnight on
the road, and the month of July 1476 was commenced
when the travellers arrived in Upper
Burgundy, and at the Castle of La Rivière, about
twenty miles to the south of the town of Salins.
The castle, which was but of small size, was surrounded
by very many tents, which were pitched
in a crowded, disordered, and unsoldierlike manner,
very unlike the discipline usually observed in
the camp of Charles the Bold. That the Duke
was present there, however, was attested by his
broad banner, which, rich with all its quarterings,
streamed from the battlements of the castle. The
guard turned out to receive the strangers, but in
a manner so disorderly that the Earl looked to
Colvin for explanation. The master of the ordnance
shrugged up his shoulders, and was silent.</p>

<p>Colvin having sent in notice of his arrival, and
that of the English Earl, Monsieur de Contay
caused them presently to be admitted, and expressed
much joy at their arrival.</p>

<p>"A few of us," he said, "true servants of the
Duke, are holding council here, at which your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
assistance, my noble Lord of Oxford, will be of
the utmost importance. Messieurs De la Croye,
De Craon, Rubempré, and others, nobles of Burgundy,
are now assembled to superintend the
defence of the country at this exigence."</p>

<p>They all expressed delight to see the Earl of
Oxford, and had only abstained from thrusting
their attentions on him the last time he was in
the Duke's camp, as they understood it was his
wish to observe incognito.</p>

<p>"His Grace," said De Craon, "has asked after
you twice, and on both times by your assumed
name of Philipson."</p>

<p>"I wonder not at that, my Lord of Craon,"
replied the English nobleman. "The origin of
the name took its rise in former days, when I was
here during my first exile. It was then said that
we poor Lancastrian nobles must assume other
names than our own, and the good Duke Philip
said, as I was brother-in-arms to his son Charles,
I must be called after himself, by the name of
Philipson. In memory of the good sovereign, I
took that name when the day of need actually
arrived, and I see that the Duke thinks of our
early intimacy by his distinguishing me so.&mdash;How
fares his Grace?"</p>

<p>The Burgundians looked at each other, and
there was a pause.</p>

<p>"Even like a man stunned, brave Oxford," at
length De Contay replied. "Sieur d'Argentin,
you can best inform the noble Earl of the condition
of our sovereign."</p>

<p>"He is like a man distracted," said the future
historian of that busy period. "After the battle
of Granson, he was never, to my thinking, of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
same sound judgment as before. But then, he
was capricious, unreasonable, peremptory, and inconsistent,
and resented every counsel that was
offered, as if it had been meant in insult; was
jealous of the least trespass in point of ceremonial,
as if his subjects were holding him in contempt.
Now there is a total change, as if this second
blow had stunned him, and suppressed the violent
passions which the first called into action. He
is silent as a Carthusian, solitary as a hermit,
expresses interest in nothing, least of all in
the guidance of his army. He was, you know,
anxious about his dress, so much so that there
was some affectation even in the rudenesses which
he practised in that matter. But, woe's me, you
will see a change now; he will not suffer his hair
or nails to be trimmed or arranged. He is totally
heedless of respect or disrespect towards him,
takes little or no nourishment, uses strong wines,
which, however, do not seem to affect his understanding;
he will hear nothing of war or state
affairs, as little of hunting or of sport. Suppose
an anchorite brought from a cell to govern a kingdom,
you see in him, except in point of devotion,
a picture of the fiery, active Charles of Burgundy."</p>

<p>"You speak of a mind deeply wounded, Sieur
d'Argentin," replied the Englishman. "Think
you it fit I should present myself before the
Duke?"</p>

<p>"I will inquire," said Contay; and, leaving the
apartment, returned presently, and made a sign to
the Earl to follow him.</p>

<p>In a cabinet, or closet, the unfortunate Charles
reclined in a large arm-chair, his legs carelessly
stretched on a footstool, but so changed that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
Earl of Oxford could have believed what he saw
to be the ghost of the once fiery Duke. Indeed,
the shaggy length of hair which, streaming from
his head, mingled with his beard; the hollowness
of the caverns, at the bottom of which rolled his
wild eyes; the falling in of the breast, and the
advance of the shoulders, gave the ghastly appearance
of one who has suffered the final agony which
takes from mortality the signs of life and energy.
His very costume (a cloak flung loosely over him)
increased his resemblance to a shrouded phantom.
De Contay named the Earl of Oxford; but the
Duke gazed on him with a lustreless eye, and gave
him no answer.</p>

<p>"Speak to him, brave Oxford," said the Burgundian
in a whisper; "he is even worse than
usual, but perhaps he may know your voice."</p>

<p>Never, when the Duke of Burgundy was in the
most palmy state of his fortunes, did the noble
Englishman kneel to kiss his hand with such
sincere reverence. He respected in him, not only
the afflicted friend, but the humbled sovereign,
upon whose tower of trust the lightning had so
recently broken. It was probably the falling of
a tear upon his hand which seemed to awake the
Duke's attention, for he looked towards the Earl,
and said, "Oxford&mdash;Philipson&mdash;my old&mdash;my
only friend, hast thou found me out in this retreat
of shame and misery?"</p>

<p>"I am not your only friend, my lord," said
Oxford. "Heaven has given you many affectionate
friends among your natural and loyal subjects.
But though a stranger, and saving the allegiance
I owe to my lawful sovereign, I will yield to none
of them in the respect and deference which I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
paid to your Grace in prosperity, and now come
to render to you in adversity."</p>

<p>"Adversity indeed!" said the Duke; "irremediable,
intolerable adversity! I was lately Charles
of Burgundy, called the Bold&mdash;now am I twice
beaten by a scum of German peasants; my standard
taken, my men-at-arms put to flight, my
camp twice plundered, and each time of value
more than equal to the price of all Switzerland
fairly lost; myself hunted like a caitiff goat or
chamois&mdash;The utmost spite of hell could never accumulate
more shame on the head of a sovereign!"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, my lord," said Oxford, "it
is a trial of Heaven, which calls for patience and
strength of mind. The bravest and best knight
may lose the saddle; he is but a laggard who lies
rolling on the sand of the lists after the accident
has chanced."</p>

<p>"Ha, laggard, say'st thou?" said the Duke,
some part of his ancient spirit awakened by the
broad taunt. "Leave my presence, sir, and return
to it no more, till you are summoned thither"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Which I trust will be no later than your Grace
quits your dishabille, and disposes yourself to see
your vassals and friends with such ceremony as
befits you and them," said the Earl composedly.</p>

<p>"How mean you by that, Sir Earl? You are
unmannerly."</p>

<p>"If I be, my lord, I am taught my ill-breeding
by circumstances. I can mourn over fallen dignity;
but I cannot honour him who dishonours
himself, by bending, like a regardless boy, beneath
the scourge of evil fortune."</p>

<p>"And who am I that you should term me
such?" said Charles, starting up in all his natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
pride and ferocity; "or who are you but a miserable
exile, that you should break in upon my
privacy with such disrespectful upbraiding?"</p>

<p>"For me," replied Oxford, "I am, as you say,
an unrespected exile; nor am I ashamed of my
condition, since unshaken loyalty to my King and
his successors has brought me to it. But in you,
can I recognise the Duke of Burgundy in a sullen
hermit, whose guards are a disorderly soldiery,
dreadful only to their friends; whose councils are
in confusion for want of their sovereign, and who
himself lurks like a lamed wolf in its den, in an
obscure castle, waiting but a blast of the Switzer's
horn to fling open its gates, which there are none
to defend; who wears not a knightly sword to
protect his person, and cannot even die like a stag
at bay, but must be worried like a hunted fox?"</p>

<p>"Death and hell, slanderous traitor!" thundered
the Duke, glancing a look at his side, and
perceiving himself without a weapon.&mdash;"It is
well for thee I have no sword, or thou shouldst
never boast of thine insolence going unpunished.&mdash;Contay,
step forth like a good knight, and confute
the calumniator. Say, are not my soldiers
arrayed, disciplined, and in order?"</p>

<p>"My lord," said Contay, trembling (brave as he
was in battle) at the frantic rage which Charles
exhibited, "there are a numerous soldiery yet
under your command, but they are in evil order,
and in worse discipline, I think, than they were
wont."</p>

<p>"I see it&mdash;I see it," said the Duke; "idle and
evil counsellors are ye all.&mdash;Hearken, Sir of Contay,
what have you and the rest of you been doing,
holding as you do large lands and high fiefs of us,

that I cannot stretch my limbs on a sick-bed,
when my heart is half broken, but my troops
must fall into such scandalous disorder as exposes
me to the scorn and reproach of each beggarly
foreigner?"</p>

<p>"My lord," replied Contay, more firmly, "we
have done what we could. But your Grace has
accustomed your mercenary generals, and leaders
of Free Companies, to take their orders only from
your own mouth, or hand. They clamour also for
pay, and the treasurer refuses to issue it without
your Grace's order, as he alleges it might cost
him his head; and they will not be guided and
restrained, either by us or those who compose your
council."</p>

<p>The Duke laughed sternly, but was evidently
somewhat pleased with the reply.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" he said, "it is only Burgundy who
can ride his own wild horses, and rule his own
wild soldiery. Hark thee, Contay&mdash;To-morrow I
ride forth to review the troops&mdash;for what disorder
has passed, allowance shall be made. Pay also
shall be issued&mdash;but woe to those who shall have
offended too deeply! Let my grooms of the chamber
know to provide me fitting dress and arms. I
have got a lesson" (glancing a dark look at Oxford),
"and I will not again be insulted without the
means of wreaking my vengeance. Begone, both
of you! And, Contay, send the treasurer hither
with his accounts, and woe to his soul if I find
aught to complain of! Begone, I say, and send
him hither."</p>

<p>They left the apartment with suitable obeisance.
As they retired, the Duke said abruptly, "Lord of
Oxford, a word with you. Where did you study
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
medicine? In your own famed university, I suppose.
Thy physic hath wrought a wonder. Yet,
Doctor Philipson, it might have cost thee thy
life."</p>

<p>"I have ever thought my life cheap," said
Oxford, "when the object was to help my friend."</p>

<p>"Thou art indeed a friend," said Charles, "and
a fearless one. But go&mdash;I have been sore troubled,
and thou hast tasked my temper closely. To-morrow
we will speak further; meantime, I forgive
thee, and I honour thee."</p>

<p>The Earl of Oxford retired to the council-hall,
where the Burgundian nobility, aware of what
had passed, crowded around him with thanks, compliments,
and congratulations. A general bustle
now ensued; orders were hurried off in every
direction. Those officers who had duties to perform
which had been neglected, hastened to conceal
or to atone for their negligence. There was a
general tumult in the camp, but it was a tumult
of joy; for soldiers are always most pleased when
they are best in order for performing their military
service; and licence or inactivity, however
acceptable at times, are not, when continued, so
agreeable to their nature, as strict discipline and
a prospect of employment.</p>

<p>The treasurer, who was, luckily for him, a
man of sense and method, having been two hours
in private with the Duke, returned with looks of
wonder, and professed that never, in Charles's
most prosperous days, had he showed himself more
acute in the department of finance, of which he
had but that morning seemed totally incapable;
and the merit was universally attributed to the
visit of Lord Oxford, whose timely reprimand had,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
like the shot of a cannon dispersing foul mists,
awakened the Duke from his black and bilious
melancholy.</p>

<p>On the following day Charles reviewed his
troops with his usual attention, directed new
levies, made various dispositions of his forces, and
corrected the faults of their discipline by severe
orders, which were enforced by some deserved
punishments (of which the Italian mercenaries
of Campo-basso had a large share), and rendered
palatable by the payment of arrears, which was
calculated to attach them to the standard under
which they served.</p>

<p>The Duke also, after consulting with his council,
agreed to convoke meetings of the States in
his different territories, redress certain popular
grievances, and grant some boons which he had
hitherto denied; and thus began to open a new
account of popularity with his subjects, in place
of that which his rashness had exhausted.

<i>Old Play.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>From this time all was activity in the Duke of
Burgundy's court and army. Money was collected,
soldiers were levied, and certain news of
the Confederates' motions only were wanting to
bring on the campaign. But although Charles
was, to all outward appearance, as active as ever,
yet those who were more immediately about his
person were of opinion that he did not display the
soundness of mind or the energy of judgment
which had been admired in him before these calamities.
He was still liable to fits of moody
melancholy, similar to those which descended
upon Saul, and was vehemently furious when
aroused out of them. Indeed, the Earl of Oxford
himself seemed to have lost the power which he
had exercised over him at first. Nay, though in
general Charles was both grateful and affectionate
towards him, he evidently felt humbled by the
recollection of his having witnessed his impotent
and disastrous condition, and was so much afraid
of Lord Oxford being supposed to lead his counsels,
that he often repelled his advice, merely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
as it seemed, to show his own independence of
mind.</p>

<p>In these froward humours the Duke was much
encouraged by Campo-basso. That wily traitor
now saw his master's affairs tottering to their fall,
and he resolved to lend his lever to the work, so
as to entitle him to a share of the spoil. He regarded
Oxford as one of the most able friends and
counsellors who adhered to the Duke; he thought
he saw in his looks that he fathomed his own
treacherous purpose, and therefore he hated and
feared him. Besides, in order perhaps to colour
over, even to his own eyes, the abominable perfidy
he meditated, he affected to be exceedingly enraged
against the Duke for the late punishment of marauders
belonging to his Italian bands. He believed
that chastisement to have been inflicted by the
advice of Oxford; and he suspected that the measure
was pressed with the hope of discovering that
the Italians had not pillaged for their own emolument
only, but for that of their commander.
Believing that Oxford was thus hostile to him,
Campo-basso would have speedily found means to
take him out of his path, had not the Earl himself
found it prudent to observe some precautions; and
the lords of Flanders and Burgundy, who loved
him for the very reasons for which the Italian
abhorred him, watched over his safety with a
vigilance of which he himself was ignorant, but
which certainly was the means of preserving his
life.</p>

<p>It was not to be supposed that Ferrand of Lorraine
should have left his victory so long unimproved;
but the Swiss Confederates, who were the
strength of his forces, insisted that the first operations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
should take place in Savoy and the Pays
de Vaud, where the Burgundians had many garrisons,
which, though they received no relief, yet
were not easily or speedily reduced. Besides, the
Switzers being, like most of the national soldiers
of the time, a kind of militia, most of them
returned home, to get in their harvest, and to
deposit their spoil in safety. Ferrand, therefore,
though bent on pursuing his success with all the
ardour of youthful chivalry, was prevented from
making any movement in advance until the month
of December 1476. In the meantime, the Duke
of Burgundy's forces, to be least burdensome to
the country, were cantoned in distant places of his
dominions, where every exertion was made to perfect
the discipline of the new levies. The Duke,
if left to himself, would have precipitated the
struggle by again assembling his forces, and pushing
forward into the Helvetian territories; but,
though he inwardly foamed at the recollection of
Granson and Murten, the memory of these disasters
was too recent to permit such a plan of the
campaign. Meantime, weeks glided past, and the
month of December was far advanced, when one
morning, as the Duke was sitting in council,
Campo-basso suddenly entered, with a degree of
extravagant rapture in his countenance, singularly
different from the cold, regulated, and subtle
smile which was usually his utmost advance towards
laughter. "<i>Guantes</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
 he said, "<i>Guantes</i>,
for luck's sake, if it please your Grace."</p>

<p>"And what of good fortune comes nigh us?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
said the Duke. "Methought she had forgot the
way to our gates."</p>

<p>"She has returned to them, please your Highness,
with her cornucopia full of choicest gifts,
ready to pour her fruit, her flowers, her treasures,
on the head of the sovereign of Europe most
worthy to receive them."</p>

<p>"The meaning of all this?" said Duke Charles.
"Riddles are for children."</p>

<p>"The harebrained young madman Ferrand, who
calls himself of Lorraine, has broken down from
the mountains, at the head of a desultory army of
scapegraces like himself; and what think you&mdash;ha!
ha! ha!&mdash;they are overrunning Lorraine, and
have taken Nancy&mdash;ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"By my good faith, Sir Count," said Contay,
astonished at the gay humour with which the
Italian treated a matter so serious, "I have seldom
heard a fool laugh more gaily at a more scurvy
jest, than you, a wise man, laugh at the loss of
the principal town of the province we are fighting
for."</p>

<p>"I laugh," said Campo-basso, "among the spears,
as my war-horse does&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;among the trumpets.
I laugh also over the destruction of the
enemy, and the dividing of the spoil, as eagles
scream their joy over the division of their prey;
I laugh"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You laugh," said the Lord of Contay, waxing
impatient, "when you have all the mirth to yourself,
as you laughed after our losses at Granson and
Murten."</p>

<p>"Peace, sir!" said the Duke. "The Count of
Campo-basso has viewed the case as I do. This
young knight-errant ventures from the protection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
of his mountains; and Heaven deal with me as I
keep my oath, when I swear that the next fair field
on which we meet shall see one of us dead! It is
now the last week of the old year, and before
Twelfth-Day we will see whether he or I shall
find the bean in the cake.&mdash;To arms, my lords!
Let our camp instantly break up, and our troops
move forward towards Lorraine. Send off the
Italian and Albanian light cavalry and the Stradiots
to scour the country in the van&mdash;Oxford,
thou wilt bear arms in this journey, wilt thou
not?"</p>

<p>"Surely," said the Earl. "I am eating your
Highness's bread; and when enemies invade, it
stands with my honour to fight for your Grace as
if I was your born subject. With your Grace's
permission, I will despatch a pursuivant, who
shall carry letters to my late kind host, the Landamman
of Unterwalden, acquainting him with
my purpose."</p>

<p>The Duke having given a ready assent, the
pursuivant was dismissed accordingly, and returned
in a few hours, so near had the armies
approached to each other. He bore a letter from
the Landamman, in a tone of courtesy and even
kindness, regretting that any cause should have
occurred for bearing arms against his late guest,
for whom he expressed high personal regard. The
same pursuivant also brought greetings from the
family of the Biedermans to their friend Arthur,
and a separate letter, addressed to the same person,
of which the contents ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Rudolph Donnerhugel is desirous to give the young
merchant, Arthur Philipson, the opportunity of finishing
the bargain which remained unsettled between them in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
the castle-court of Geierstein. He is the more desirous
of this, as he is aware that the said Arthur has done
him wrong, in seducing the affections of a certain
maiden of rank, to whom he, Philipson, is not, and
cannot be, anything beyond an ordinary acquaintance.
Rudolph Donnerhugel will send Arthur Philipson word
when a fair and equal meeting can take place on neutral
ground. In the meantime, he will be as often as
possible in the first rank of the skirmishers."
</p>
</div>
<p>Young Arthur's heart leapt high as he read the
defiance, the piqued tone of which showed the
state of the writer's feelings, and argued sufficiently
Rudolph's disappointment on the subject
of Anne of Geierstein, and his suspicion that
she had bestowed her affections on the youthful
stranger. Arthur found means of despatching a
reply to the challenge of the Swiss, assuring him
of the pleasure with which he would attend his
commands, either in front of the line or elsewhere,
as Rudolph might desire.</p>

<p>Meantime the armies were closely approaching
to each other, and the light troops sometimes met.
The Stradiots from the Venetian territory, a sort
of cavalry resembling that of the Turks, performed
much of that service on the part of the Burgundian
army, for which, indeed, if their fidelity could have
been relied on, they were admirably well qualified.
The Earl of Oxford observed that these men, who
were under the command of Campo-basso, always
brought in intelligence that the enemy were in
indifferent order, and in full retreat. Besides,
information was communicated through their
means that sundry individuals, against whom the
Duke of Burgundy entertained peculiar personal
dislike, and whom he specially desired to get into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
his hands, had taken refuge in Nancy. This
greatly increased the Duke's ardour for retaking
that place, which became perfectly ungovernable
when he learned that Ferrand and his Swiss allies
had drawn off to a neighbouring position called
St. Nicholas, on the news of his arrival. The
greater part of the Burgundian counsellors, together
with the Earl of Oxford, protested against
his besieging a place of some strength, while an
active enemy lay in the neighbourhood to relieve
it. They remonstrated on the smallness of his
army, on the severity of the weather, on the difficulty
of obtaining provisions, and exhorted the
Duke that, having made such a movement as had
forced the enemy to retreat, he ought to suspend
decisive operations till spring. Charles at first
tried to dispute and repel these arguments; but
when his counsellors reminded him that he was
placing himself and his army in the same situation
as at Granson and Murten, he became
furious at the recollection, foamed at the mouth,
and only answered by oaths and imprecations,
that he would be master of Nancy before Twelfth
Day.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the army of Burgundy sat down
before Nancy, in a strong position, protected by
the hollow of a watercourse, and covered with
thirty pieces of cannon, which Colvin had under
his charge.</p>

<p>Having indulged his obstinate temper in thus
arranging the campaign, the Duke seemed to give
a little more heed to the advice of his counsellors
touching the safety of his person, and permitted
the Earl of Oxford, with his son, and two or three
officers of his household, men of approved trust,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
to sleep within his pavilion, in addition to the
usual guard.</p>

<p>It wanted three days of Christmas when the
Duke sat down before Nancy, and on that very
evening a tumult happened which seemed to
justify the alarm for his personal safety. It was
midnight, and all in the ducal pavilion were at
rest, when a cry of treason arose. The Earl of
Oxford, drawing his sword, and snatching up a
light which burned beside him, rushed into the
Duke's apartment, and found him standing on the
floor totally undressed, but with his sword in his
hand, and striking around him so furiously, that
the Earl himself had difficulty in avoiding his
blows. The rest of his officers rushed in, their
weapons drawn, and their cloaks wrapped around
their left arms. When the Duke was somewhat
composed, and found himself surrounded by his
friends, he informed them, with rage and agitation,
that the officers of the Secret Tribunal had,
in spite of the vigilant precautions taken, found
means to gain entrance into his chamber, and
charged him, under the highest penalty, to appear
before the Holy Vehme upon Christmas night.</p>

<p>The bystanders heard this story with astonishment,
and some of them were uncertain whether
they ought to consider it as a reality, or a dream
of the Duke's irritable fancy. But the citation
was found on the Duke's toilette, written, as was
the form, upon parchment, signeted with three
crosses, and stuck to the table with a knife. A
slip of wood had been also cut from the table.
Oxford read the summons with attention. It
named, as usual, a place where the Duke was
cited to come unarmed and unattended, and from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
which it was said he would be guided to the seat
of judgment.</p>

<p>Charles, after looking at the scroll for some
time, gave vent to his thoughts.</p>

<p>"I know from what quiver this arrow comes,"
he said. "It is shot by that degenerate noble,
apostate priest, and accomplice of sorcerers, Albert
of Geierstein. We have heard that he is among
the motley group of murderers and outlaws whom
the old fiddler of Provence's grandson has raked
together. But, by St. George of Burgundy! neither
monk's cowl, soldier's casque, nor conjurer's
cap shall save him after such an insult as this.
I will degrade him from knighthood, hang him from
the highest steeple in Nancy, and his daughter
shall choose between the meanest herd-boy in my
army and the convent of <i>filles repentées</i>!"</p>

<p>"Whatever are your purposes, my lord," said
Contay, "it were surely best be silent, when, from
this late apparition, we may conjecture that more
than we wot of may be within hearing."</p>

<p>The Duke seemed struck with this hint, and
was silent, or at least only muttered oaths and
threats betwixt his teeth, while the strictest
search was made for the intruder on his repose.
But it was in vain.</p>

<p>Charles continued his researches, incensed at a
flight of audacity higher than ever had been ventured
upon by these secret societies, who, whatever
might be the dread inspired by them, had
not as yet attempted to cope with sovereigns. A
trusty party of Burgundians were sent on Christmas
night to watch the spot (a meeting of four
cross roads) named in the summons, and make
prisoners of any whom they could lay hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
upon; but no suspicious persons appeared at or
near the place. The Duke not the less continued
to impute the affront he had received to Albert
of Geierstein. There was a price set upon his
head; and Campo-basso, always willing to please
his master's mood, undertook that some of his
Italians, sufficiently experienced in such feats,
should bring the obnoxious baron before him,
alive or dead. Colvin, Contay, and others laughed
in secret at the Italian's promises.</p>

<p>"Subtle as he is," said Colvin, "he will lure
the wild vulture from the heavens before he gets
Albert of Geierstein into his power."</p>

<p>Arthur, to whom the words of the Duke had
given subject for no small anxiety, on account of
Anne of Geierstein, and of her father for her sake,
breathed more lightly on hearing his menaces
held so cheaply.</p>

<p>It was the second day after this alarm that
Oxford felt a desire to reconnoitre the camp of
Ferrand of Lorraine, having some doubts whether
the strength and position of it were accurately
reported. He obtained the Duke's consent for
this purpose, who at the same time made him
and his son a present of two noble steeds of
great power and speed, which he himself highly
valued.</p>

<p>So soon as the Duke's pleasure was communicated
to the Italian count, he expressed the utmost
joy that he was to have the assistance of Oxford's
age and experience upon an exploratory party, and
selected a chosen band of an hundred Stradiots,
whom he said he had sent sometimes to skirmish
up to the very beards of the Switzers. The Earl
showed himself much satisfied with the active and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
intelligent manner in which these men performed
their duty, and drove before them and dispersed
some parties of Ferrand's cavalry. At the entrance
of a little ascending valley, Campo-basso
communicated to the English noblemen that if
they could advance to the farther extremity they
would have a full view of the enemy's position.
Two or three Stradiots then spurred on to examine
this defile, and, returning back, communicated
with their leader in their own language, who,
pronouncing the passage safe, invited the Earl
of Oxford to accompany him. They proceeded
through the valley without seeing an enemy, but
on issuing upon a plain at the point intimated by
Campo-basso, Arthur, who was in the van of the
Stradiots, and separated from his father, did indeed
see the camp of Duke Ferrand within half
a mile's distance; but a body of cavalry had that
instant issued from it, and were riding hastily
towards the gorge of the valley from which he had
just emerged. He was about to wheel his horse
and ride off, but, conscious of the great speed of
the animal, he thought he might venture to stay
for a moment's more accurate survey of the camp.
The Stradiots who attended him did not wait his
orders to retire, but went off, as was indeed their
duty, when attacked by a superior force.</p>

<p>Meantime, Arthur observed that the knight who
seemed leader of the advancing squadron, mounted
on a powerful horse that shook the earth beneath
him, bore on his shield the Bear of Berne, and
had otherwise the appearance of the massive frame
of Rudolph Donnerhugel. He was satisfied of this
when he beheld the cavalier halt his party and
advance towards him alone, putting his lance in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
rest, and moving slowly, as if to give him time
for preparation. To accept such a challenge, in
such a moment, was dangerous, but to refuse it
was disgraceful; and while Arthur's blood boiled
at the idea of chastising an insolent rival, he was
not a little pleased at heart that their meeting on
horseback gave him an advantage over the Swiss,
through his perfect acquaintance with the practice
of the tourney, in which Rudolph might be supposed
more ignorant.</p>

<p>They met, as was the phrase of the time, "manful
under shield." The lance of the Swiss glanced
from the helmet of the Englishman, against which
it was addressed, while the spear of Arthur, directed
right against the centre of his adversary's
body, was so justly aimed, and so truly seconded
by the full fury of the career, as to pierce, not
only the shield which hung round the ill-fated
warrior's neck, but a breast-plate and a shirt of
mail which he wore beneath it. Passing clear
through the body, the steel point of the weapon
was only stopped by the back-piece of the unfortunate
cavalier, who fell headlong from his horse, as
if struck by lightning, rolled twice or thrice over
on the ground, tore the earth with his hands, and
then lay prostrate a dead corpse.</p>

<p>There was a cry of rage and grief among those
men-at-arms whose ranks Rudolph had that instant
left, and many couched their lances to avenge
him; but Ferrand of Lorraine, who was present in
person, ordered them to make prisoner, but not to
harm, the successful champion. This was accomplished,
for Arthur had not time to turn his bridle
for flight, and resistance would have been madness.</p>

<p>When brought before Ferrand, he raised his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
visor, and said, "Is it well, my lord, to make captive
an adventurous knight, for doing his devoir
against a personal challenger?"</p>

<p>"Do not complain, Sir Arthur of Oxford," said
Ferrand, "before you experience injury. You are
free, Sir Knight. Your father and you were faithful
to my royal aunt Margaret, and, although she
was my enemy, I do justice to your fidelity in her
behalf; and from respect to her memory, disinherited
as she was like myself, and to please my
grandfather, who I think had some regard for you,
I give you your freedom. But I must also care
for your safety during your return to the camp of
Burgundy. On this side of the hill we are loyal
and true-hearted men, on the other they are traitors
and murderers. You, Sir Count, will, I think,
gladly see our captive placed in safety."</p>

<p>The knight to whom Ferrand addressed himself,
a tall, stately man, put himself in motion to attend
on Arthur, while the former was expressing to the
young Duke of Lorraine the sense he entertained
of his chivalrous conduct. "Farewell, Sir Arthur
de Vere," said Ferrand. "You have slain a noble
champion, and to me a most useful and faithful
friend. But it was done nobly and openly, with
equal arms, and in the front of the line; and evil
befall him who entertains feud first!" Arthur
bowed to his saddle-bow. Ferrand returned the
salutation, and they parted.</p>

<p>Arthur and his new companion had ridden but
a little way up the ascent, when the stranger spoke
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have been fellow-travellers before, young
man, yet you remember me not."</p>

<p>Arthur turned his eyes on the cavalier, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
observing that the crest which adorned his helmet
was fashioned like a vulture, strange suspicions
began to cross his mind, which were confirmed
when the knight, opening his helmet, showed him
the dark and severe features of the Priest of St.
Paul's.</p>

<p>"Count Albert of Geierstein!" said Arthur.</p>

<p>"The same," replied the count, "though thou
hast seen him in other garb and headgear. But
tyranny drives all men to arms, and I have resumed,
by the licence and command of my superiors,
those which I had laid aside. A war against
cruelty and oppression is holy as that waged in
Palestine, in which priests bear armour."</p>

<p>"My Lord Count," said Arthur, eagerly, "I cannot
too soon entreat you to withdraw to Sir Ferrand
of Lorraine's squadron. Here you are in
peril, where no strength or courage can avail you.
The Duke has placed a price on your head; and
the country betwixt this and Nancy swarms with
Stradiots and Italian light horsemen."</p>

<p>"I laugh at them," answered the count. "I
have not lived so long in a stormy world, amid
intrigues of war and policy, to fall by the mean
hand of such as they&mdash;besides, thou art with me,
and I have seen but now that thou canst bear thee
nobly."</p>

<p>"In your defence, my lord," said Arthur, who
thought of his companion as the father of Anne of
Geierstein, "I should try to do my best."</p>

<p>"What, youth!" replied Count Albert with a
stern sneer, that was peculiar to his countenance;
"wouldst thou aid the enemy of the lord under
whose banner thou servest against his waged
soldiers?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>

<p>Arthur was somewhat abashed at the turn given
to his ready offer of assistance, for which he had
expected at least thanks; but he instantly collected
himself, and replied, "My Lord Count
Albert, you have been pleased to put yourself in
peril to protect me from partisans of your party&mdash;I
am equally bound to defend you from those of
our side."</p>

<p>"It is happily answered," said the count; "yet
I think there is a little blind partisan, of whom
troubadours and minstrels talk, to whose instigation
I might, in case of need, owe the great zeal of
my protector."</p>

<p>He did not allow Arthur, who was a good deal
embarrassed, time to reply, but proceeded: "Hear
me, young man&mdash;Thy lance has this day done
an evil deed to Switzerland, to Berne, and Duke
Ferrand, in slaying their bravest champion. But
to me the death of Rudolph Donnerhugel is a welcome
event. Know that he was, as his services
grew more indispensable, become importunate in
requiring Duke Ferrand's interest with me for my
daughter's hand. And the Duke himself, the son
of a princess, blushed not to ask me to bestow the
last of my house&mdash;for my brother's family are
degenerate mongrels&mdash;upon a presumptuous young
man, whose uncle was a domestic in the house of
my wife's father, though they boasted some relationship,
I believe, through an illegitimate channel,
which yonder Rudolph was wont to make the
most of, as it favoured his suit."</p>

<p>"Surely," said Arthur, "a match with one so
unequal in birth, and far more in every other
respect, was too monstrous to be mentioned?"</p>

<p>"While I lived," replied Count Albert, "never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
should such union have been formed, if the death
both of bride and bridegroom by my dagger could
have saved the honour of my house from violation.
But when I&mdash;I whose days, whose very hours are
numbered&mdash;shall be no more, what could prevent
an undaunted suitor, fortified by Duke Ferrand's
favour, by the general applause of his country, and
perhaps by the unfortunate prepossession of my
brother Arnold, from carrying his point against
the resistance and scruples of a solitary maiden?"</p>

<p>"Rudolph is dead," replied Arthur, "and may
Heaven assoilzie him from guilt! But were he
alive, and urging his suit on Anne of Geierstein, he
would find there was a combat to be fought"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Which has been already decided," answered
Count Albert. "Now, mark me, Arthur de Vere!
My daughter has told me of the passages betwixt
you and her. Your sentiments and conduct are
worthy of the noble house you descend from,
which I well know ranks with the most illustrious
in Europe. You are indeed disinherited, but so is
Anne of Geierstein, save such pittance as her uncle
may impart to her of her paternal inheritance. If
you share it together till better days (always supposing
your noble father gives his consent, for my
child shall enter no house against the will of its
head), my daughter knows that she has my willing
consent, and my blessing. My brother shall also
know my pleasure. He will approve my purpose;
for, though dead to thoughts of honour and chivalry,
he is alive to social feelings, loves his niece,
and has friendship for thee and for thy father.
What say'st thou, young man, to taking a beggarly
countess to aid thee in the journey of life?
I believe&mdash;nay, I prophesy (for I stand so much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
on the edge of the grave, that methinks I command
a view beyond it), that a lustre will one day, after
I have long ended my doubtful and stormy life,
beam on the coronets of De Vere and Geierstein."</p>

<p>De Vere threw himself from his horse, clasped
the hand of Count Albert, and was about to exhaust
himself in thanks; but the count insisted
on his silence.</p>

<p>"We are about to part," he said. "The time is
short&mdash;the place is dangerous. You are to me,
personally speaking, less than nothing. Had any
one of the many schemes of ambition which I have
pursued led me to success, the son of a banished
earl had not been the son-in-law I had chosen.
Rise and remount your horse&mdash;thanks are unpleasing
when they are not merited."</p>

<p>Arthur arose, and, mounting his horse, threw
his raptures into a more acceptable form, endeavouring
to describe how his love for Anne, and
efforts for her happiness, should express his gratitude
to her father; and, observing that the count
listened with some pleasure to the picture he
drew of their future life, he could not help exclaiming,&mdash;"And
you, my lord&mdash;you who have
been the author of all this happiness, will you not
be the witness and partaker of it? Believe me, we
will strive to soften the effect of the hard blows
which fortune has dealt to you, and, should a ray
of better luck shine upon us, it will be the more
welcome that you can share it."</p>

<p>"Forbear such folly," said the Count Albert of
Geierstein. "I know my last scene is approaching.
Hear and tremble. The Duke of Burgundy is sentenced
to die, and the Secret and Invisible Judges,
who doom in secret and avenge in secret, like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
Deity, have given the cord and the dagger to my
hand."</p>

<p>"Oh, cast from you these vile symbols!" exclaimed
Arthur, with enthusiasm; "let them find
butchers and common stabbers to do such an office,
and not dishonour the noble Lord of Geierstein!"</p>

<p>"Peace, foolish boy!" answered the count.
"The oath by which I am sworn is higher than
that clouded sky, more deeply fixed than those
distant mountains. Nor think my act is that of
an assassin, though for such I might plead the
Duke's own example. I send not hirelings, like
these base Stradiots, to hunt his life, without imperilling
mine own. I give not his daughter&mdash;innocent
of his offences&mdash;the choice betwixt a
disgraceful marriage and a discreditable retreat
from the world. No, Arthur de Vere, I seek
Charles with the resolved mind of one who, to
take the life of an adversary, exposes himself to
certain death."</p>

<p>"I pray you speak no further of it," said Arthur,
very anxiously. "Consider I serve for the present
the prince whom you threaten"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And art bound," interrupted the count, "to
unfold to him what I tell you. I desire you should
do so; and though he hath already neglected a
summons of the Tribunal, I am glad to have this
opportunity of sending him personal defiance. Say
to Charles of Burgundy that he has wronged Albert
of Geierstein. He who is injured in his honour
loses all value for his life, and whoever does so
has full command over that of another man. Bid
him keep himself well from me, since, if he see a
second sun of the approaching year rise over the
distant Alps, Albert of Geierstein is forsworn.&mdash;And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
now begone, for I see a party approach under
a Burgundian banner. They will insure your
safety, but, should I remain longer, would endanger
mine."</p>

<p>So saying, the Count of Geierstein turned his
horse and rode off.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div>

<p>Arthur, left alone, and desirous perhaps to cover
the retreat of Count Albert, rode towards the approaching
body of Burgundian cavalry, who were
arrayed under the Lord Contay's banner.</p>

<p>"Welcome, welcome," said that nobleman, advancing
hastily to the young knight. "The Duke
of Burgundy is a mile hence, with a body of horse
to support the reconnoitring party. It is not half
an hour since your father galloped up, and stated
that you had been led into an ambuscade by the
treachery of the Stradiots, and made prisoner. He
has impeached Campo-basso of treason, and challenged
him to the combat. They have both been
sent to the camp, under charge of the Grand Marshal,
to prevent their fighting on the spot, though
I think our Italian showed little desire to come
to blows. The Duke holds their gages, and they
are to fight upon Twelfth Day."</p>

<p>"I doubt that day will never dawn for some
who look for it," said Arthur; "but if it do, I
will myself claim the combat, by my father's
permission."</p>

<p>He then turned with Contay, and met a still
larger body of cavalry under the Duke's broad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
banner. He was instantly brought before Charles.
The Duke heard, with some apparent anxiety,
Arthur's support of his father's accusations against
the Italian, in whose favour he was so deeply prejudiced.
When assured that the Stradiots had
been across the hill, and communicated with their
leader just before he encouraged Arthur to advance,
as it proved, into the midst of an ambush,
the Duke shook his head, lowered his shaggy
brows, and muttered to himself,&mdash;"Ill will to
Oxford, perhaps&mdash;these Italians are vindictive."&mdash;Then
raising his head, he commanded Arthur to
proceed.</p>

<p>He heard with a species of ecstasy the death
of Rudolph Donnerhugel, and, taking a ponderous
gold chain from his own neck, flung it over
Arthur's.</p>

<p>"Why, thou hast forestalled all our honours,
young Arthur&mdash;this was the biggest bear of them
all&mdash;the rest are but suckling whelps to him!
I think I have found a youthful David to match
their huge thick-headed Goliath. But the idiot,
to think his peasant hand could manage a lance!
Well, my brave boy&mdash;what more? How camest
thou off? By some wily device or agile stratagem,
I warrant."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my lord," answered Arthur. "I
was protected by their chief, Ferrand, who considered
my encounter with Rudolph Donnerhugel
as a personal duel; and desirous to use fair war,
as he said, dismissed me honourably, with my
horse and arms."</p>

<p>"Umph!" said Charles, his bad humour returning;
"your Prince Adventurer must play the
generous&mdash;Umph&mdash;well, it belongs to his part,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
but shall not be a line for me to square my conduct
by. Proceed with your story, Sir Arthur de
Vere."</p>

<p>As Arthur proceeded to tell how and under what
circumstances Count Albert of Geierstein named
himself to him, the Duke fixed on him an eager
look, and trembled with impatience as he fiercely
interrupted him with the question&mdash;"And you&mdash;you
struck him with your poniard under the fifth
rib, did you not?"</p>

<p>"I did not, my Lord Duke&mdash;we were pledged
in mutual assurance to each other."</p>

<p>"Yet you knew him to be my mortal enemy?"
said the Duke. "Go, young man, thy lukewarm
indifference has cancelled thy merit. The escape
of Albert of Geierstein hath counterbalanced the
death of Rudolph Donnerhugel."</p>

<p>"Be it so, my lord," said Arthur, boldly. "I
neither claim your praises, nor deprecate your censure.
I had to move me in either case motives
personal to myself&mdash;Donnerhugel was my enemy,
and to Count Albert I owe some kindness."</p>

<p>The Burgundian nobles who stood around were
terrified for the effect of this bold speech. But it
was never possible to guess with accuracy how
such things would affect Charles. He looked
around him with a laugh&mdash;"Hear you this English
cockerel, my lords&mdash;what a note will he one
day sound, that already crows so bravely in a
prince's presence?"</p>

<p>A few horsemen now came in from different
quarters, recounting that the Duke Ferrand and
his company had retired into their encampment,
and the country was clear of the enemy.</p>

<p>"Let us then draw back also," said Charles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
"since there is no chance of breaking spears to-day.
And thou, Arthur de Vere, attend me
closely."</p>

<p>Arrived in the Duke's pavilion, Arthur underwent
an examination, in which he said nothing of
Anne of Geierstein, or her father's designs concerning
him, with which he considered Charles as
having nothing to do; but he frankly conveyed to
him the personal threats which the count had
openly used. The Duke listened with more temper,
and when he heard the expression, "That a
man who is desperate of his own life might command
that of any other person," he said, "But
there is a life beyond this, in which he who is
treacherously murdered, and his base and desperate
assassin, shall each meet their deserts." He then
took from his bosom a gold cross, and kissed it,
with much appearance of devotion. "In this,"
said he, "I will place my trust. If I fail in this
world, may I find grace in the next.&mdash;Ho, Sir
Marshal!" he exclaimed. "Let your prisoners
attend us."</p>

<p>The Marshal of Burgundy entered with the Earl
of Oxford, and stated that his other prisoner,
Campo-basso, had desired so earnestly that he
might be suffered to go and post his sentinels on
that part of the camp intrusted to the protection of
his troops, that he, the Marshal, had thought fit
to comply with his request.</p>

<p>"It is well," said Burgundy, without further
remark. "Then to you, my Lord Oxford, I would
present your son, had you not already locked him
in your arms. He has won great los and honour,
and done me brave service. This is a period of
the year when good men forgive their enemies;&mdash;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
know not why,&mdash;my mind was little apt to be
charged with such matters,&mdash;but I feel an unconquerable
desire to stop the approaching combat
betwixt you and Campo-basso. For my sake, consent
to be friends, and to receive back your gage
of battle, and let me conclude this year&mdash;perhaps
the last I may see&mdash;with a deed of peace."</p>

<p>"My lord," said Oxford, "it is a small thing
you ask of me, since your request only enforces a
Christian duty. I was enraged at the loss of my
son. I am grateful to Heaven and your Grace for
restoring him. To be friends with Campo-basso is
to me impossible. Faith and treason, truth and
falsehood, might as soon shake hands and embrace.
But the Italian shall be to me no more than he
has been before this rupture; and that is literally
nothing. I put my honour in your Grace's hands;&mdash;if
he receives back his gage, I am willing to
receive mine. John de Vere needs not be apprehensive
that the world will suppose that he fears
Campo-basso."</p>

<p>The Duke returned sincere thanks, and detained
the officers to spend the evening in his tent. His
manners seemed to Arthur to be more placid than
he had ever seen them before, while to the Earl of
Oxford they recalled the earlier days in which
their intimacy commenced, ere absolute power and
unbounded success had spoiled Charles's rough but
not ungenerous disposition. The Duke ordered a
distribution of provisions and wine to the soldiers,
and expressed an anxiety about their lodgings, the
cure of the wounded, and the health of the army,
to which he received only unpleasing answers. To
some of his counsellors, apart, he said, "Were it
not for our vow, we would relinquish this purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
till spring, when our poor soldiers might take the
field with less of suffering."</p>

<p>Nothing else remarkable appeared in the Duke's
manner, save that he inquired repeatedly after
Campo-basso, and at length received accounts that
he was indisposed, and that his physician had
recommended rest; he had therefore retired to
repose himself, in order that he might be stirring
on his duty at peep of day, the safety of the camp
depending much on his vigilance.</p>

<p>The Duke made no observation on the apology,
which he considered as indicating some lurking
disinclination, on the Italian's part, to meet
Oxford. The guests at the ducal pavilion were
dismissed an hour before midnight.</p>

<p>When Oxford and his son were in their own
tent, the Earl fell into a deep reverie, which lasted
nearly ten minutes. At length, starting suddenly
up, he said, "My son, give orders to Thiebault
and thy yeomen to have our horses before the tent
by break of day, or rather before it; and it would
not be amiss if you ask our neighbour Colvin to
ride along with us. I will visit the outposts by
daybreak."</p>

<p>"It is a sudden resolution, my lord," said
Arthur.</p>

<p>"And yet it may be taken too late," said his
father. "Had it been moonlight, I would have
made the rounds to-night."</p>

<p>"It is dark as a wolf's throat," said Arthur.
"But wherefore, my lord, can this night in particular
excite your apprehensions?"</p>

<p>"Son Arthur, perhaps you will hold your father
credulous. But my nurse, Martha Nixon, was a
northern woman, and full of superstitions. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
particular, she was wont to say, that any sudden
and causeless change of a man's nature, as from
licence to sobriety, from temperance to indulgence,
from avarice to extravagance, from prodigality to
love of money, or the like, indicates an immediate
change of his fortunes&mdash;that some great alteration
of circumstances, either for good or evil (and
for evil most likely, since we live in an evil
world), is impending over him whose disposition
is so much altered. This old woman's fancy has
recurred so strongly to my mind, that I am determined
to see with mine own eyes, ere to-morrow's
dawn, that all our guards and patrols around the
camp are on the alert."</p>

<p>Arthur made the necessary communications to
Colvin and to Thiebault, and then retired to rest.</p>

<p>It was ere daybreak of the first of January 1477,
a period long memorable for the events which
marked it, that the Earl of Oxford, Colvin, and
the young Englishman, followed only by Thiebault
and two other servants, commenced their rounds
of the Duke of Burgundy's encampment. For the
greater part of their progress they found sentinels
and guards all on the alert and at their posts. It
was a bitter morning. The ground was partly
covered with snow,&mdash;that snow had been partly
melted by a thaw, which had prevailed for two
days, and partly congealed into ice by a bitter
frost, which had commenced the preceding evening,
and still continued. A more dreary scene
could scarcely be witnessed.</p>

<p>But what were the surprise and alarm of the
Earl of Oxford and his companions, when they
came to that part of the camp which had been
occupied the day before by Campo-basso and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
Italians, who, reckoning men-at-arms and Stradiots,
amounted to nigh two thousand men&mdash;not
a challenge was given&mdash;not a horse neighed&mdash;no
steeds were seen at picket&mdash;no guard on the camp.
They examined several of the tents and huts&mdash;they
were empty.</p>

<p>"Let us back to alarm the camp," said the Earl
of Oxford; "here is treachery."</p>

<p>"Nay, my lord," said Colvin, "let us not carry
back imperfect tidings. I have a battery an hundred
yards in advance, covering the access to this
hollow way; let us see if my German cannoneers
are at their post, and I think I can swear that
we shall find them so. The battery commands a
narrow pass, by which alone the camp can be
approached, and if my men are at their duty, I will
pawn my life that we make the pass good till you
bring up succours from the main body."</p>

<p>"Forward, then, in God's name!" said the Earl
of Oxford.</p>

<p>They galloped, at every risk, over broken ground,
slippery with ice in some places, incumbered with
snow in others. They came to the cannon, judiciously
placed to sweep the pass, which rose
towards the artillery on the outward side, and
then descended gently from the battery into the
lower ground. The waning winter moon, mingling
with the dawning light, showed them that the guns
were in their places, but no sentinel was visible.</p>

<p>"The villains cannot have deserted!" said the
astonished Colvin. "But see, there is light in
their cantonment. Oh, that unhallowed distribution
of wine! Their usual sin of drunkenness has
beset them. I will soon drive them from their
revelry."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span></p>

<p>He sprang from his horse, and rushed into the
tent whence the light issued. The cannoneers, or
most of them, were still there, but stretched on
the ground, their cups and flagons scattered around
them; and so drenched were they in wassail, that
Colvin could only, by commands and threats,
awaken two or three, who, staggering, and obeying
him rather from instinct than sense, reeled forward
to man the battery. A heavy rushing sound,
like that of men marching fast, was now heard
coming up the pass.</p>

<p>"It is the roar of a distant avalanche," said
Arthur.</p>

<p>"It is an avalanche of Switzers, not of snow,"
said Colvin. "Oh, these drunken slaves! The
cannon are deeply loaded and well pointed&mdash;this
volley must check them if they were fiends, and
the report will alarm the camp sooner than we can
do. But, oh, these drunken villains!"</p>

<p>"Care not for their aid," said the Earl; "my
son and I will each take a linstock, and be gunners
for once."</p>

<p>They dismounted, and bade Thiebault and the
grooms look to the horses, while the Earl of
Oxford and his son took each a linstock from one
of the helpless gunners, three of whom were just
sober enough to stand by their guns.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried the bold master of ordnance,
"never was a battery so noble. Now, my mates&mdash;your
pardon, my lords, for there is no time for
ceremony,&mdash;and you, ye drunken knaves, take
heed not to fire till I give the word, and, were the
ribs of these tramplers as flinty as their Alps, they
shall know how old Colvin loads his guns."</p>

<p>They stood breathless, each by his cannon. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
dreaded sound approached nearer and more near,
till the imperfect light showed a dark and shadowy
but dense column of men, armed with long
spears, pole-axes, and other weapons, amidst which
banners dimly floated. Colvin suffered them to
approach to the distance of about forty yards, and
then gave the word, Fire! But his own piece
alone exploded; a slight flame flashed from the
touch-hole of the others, which had been spiked
by the Italian deserters, and left in reality disabled,
though apparently fit for service. Had
they been all in the same condition with that fired
by Colvin, they would probably have verified his
prophecy; for even that single discharge produced
an awful effect, and made a long lane of dead and
wounded through the Swiss column, in which the
first and leading banner was struck down.</p>

<p>"Stand to it yet," said Colvin, "and aid me if
possible to reload the piece."</p>

<p>For this, however, no time was allowed. A
stately form, conspicuous in the front of the staggered
column, raised up the fallen banner, and a
voice as of a giant exclaimed, "What, countrymen!
have you seen Murten and Granson, and are
you daunted by a single gun?&mdash;Berne&mdash;Uri&mdash;Schwitz&mdash;banners
forward! Unterwalden, here is
your standard!&mdash;Cry your war-cries, wind your
horns; Unterwalden, follow your Landamman!"</p>

<p>They rushed on like a raging ocean, with a roar
as deafening, and a course as impetuous. Colvin,
still labouring to reload his gun, was struck down
in the act. Oxford and his son were overthrown
by the multitude, the closeness of which prevented
any blows being aimed at them. Arthur
partly saved himself by getting under the gun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
he was posted at; his father, less fortunate, was
much trampled upon, and must have been crushed
to death but for his armour of proof. The human
inundation, consisting of at least four thousand
men, rushed down into the camp, continuing their
dreadful shouts, soon mingled with shrill shrieks,
groans, and cries of alarm.</p>

<p>A broad red glare rising behind the assailants,
and putting to shame the pallid lights of the
winter morning, first recalled Arthur to a sense of
his condition. The camp was on fire in his rear,
and resounded with all the various shouts of conquest
and terror that are heard in a town which is
stormed. Starting to his feet, he looked around
him for his father. He lay near him senseless,
as were the gunners, whose condition prevented
their attempting an escape. Having opened his
father's casque, he was rejoiced to see him give
symptoms of reanimation.</p>

<p>"The horses, the horses!" said Arthur. "Thiebault,
where art thou?"</p>

<p>"At hand, my lord," said that trusty attendant,
who had saved himself and his charge by a prudent
retreat into a small thicket, which the assailants
had avoided that they might not disorder their
ranks.</p>

<p>"Where is the gallant Colvin?" said the Earl.
"Get him a horse, I will not leave him in
jeopardy."</p>

<p>"His wars are ended, my lord," said Thiebault;
"he will never mount steed more."</p>

<p>A look and a sigh as he saw Colvin, with the
ramrod in his hand, before the muzzle of the piece,
his head cleft by a Swiss battle-axe, was all the
moment permitted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span></p>

<p>"Whither must we take our course?" said
Arthur to his father.</p>

<p>"To join the Duke," said the Earl of Oxford.
"It is not on a day like this that I will leave
him."</p>

<p>"So please you," said Thiebault, "I saw the
Duke, followed by some half-score of his guards,
riding at full speed across this hollow watercourse,
and making for the open country to the northward.
I think I can guide you on the track."</p>

<p>"If that be so," replied Oxford, "we will mount
and follow him. The camp has been assailed on
several places at once, and all must be over since
he has fled."</p>

<p>With difficulty they assisted the Earl of Oxford
to his horse, and rode, as fast as his returning
strength permitted, in the direction which the
Provençal pointed out. Their other attendants
were dispersed or slain.</p>

<p>They looked back more than once on the camp,
now one great scene of conflagration, by whose red
and glaring light they could discover on the ground
the traces of Charles's retreat. About three miles
from the scene of their defeat, the sound of which
they still heard, mingled with the bells of Nancy,
which were ringing in triumph, they reached a
half-frozen swamp, round which lay several dead
bodies. The most conspicuous was that of Charles
of Burgundy, once the possessor of such unlimited
power&mdash;such unbounded wealth. He was partly
stripped and plundered, as were those who lay
round him. His body was pierced with several
wounds, inflicted by various weapons. His sword
was still in his hand, and the singular ferocity
which was wont to animate his features in battle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
still dwelt on his stiffened countenance. Close
behind him, as if they had fallen in the act of
mutual fight, lay the corpse of Count Albert of
Geierstein; and that of Ital Schreckenwald, the
faithful though unscrupulous follower of the latter,
lay not far distant. Both were in the dress of the
men-at-arms composing the Duke's guard, a disguise
probably assumed to execute the fatal commission
of the Secret Tribunal. It is supposed
that a party of the traitor Campo-basso's men had
been engaged in the skirmish in which the Duke fell,
for six or seven of them, and about the same number
of the Duke's guards, were found near the spot.</p>

<p>The Earl of Oxford threw himself from his
horse, and examined the body of his deceased
brother-in-arms, with all the sorrow inspired by
early remembrance of his kindness. But as he
gave way to the feelings inspired by so melancholy
an example of the fall of human greatness,
Thiebault, who was looking out on the path they
had just pursued, exclaimed, "To horse, my lord!
here is no time to mourn the dead, and little to
save the living&mdash;the Swiss are upon us."</p>

<p>"Fly thyself, good fellow," said the Earl; "and
do thou, Arthur, fly also, and save thy youth for
happier days. I cannot and will not fly farther.
I will render me to the pursuers; if they take me
to grace, it is well; if not, there is one above that
will receive me to His."</p>

<p>"I will not fly," said Arthur, "and leave you
defenceless; I will stay and share your fate."</p>

<p>"And I will remain also," said Thiebault; "the
Switzers make fair war when their blood has not
been heated by much opposition, and they have
had little enough to-day."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>

<p>The party of Swiss which came up proved to be
Sigismund, with his brother Ernest, and some of
the youths of Unterwalden. Sigismund kindly
and joyfully received them to mercy; and thus,
for the third time, rendered Arthur an important
service, in return for the kindness he had expressed
towards him.</p>

<p>"I will take you to my father," said Sigismund,
"who will be right glad to see you; only that he
is ill at ease just now for the death of brother
Rudiger, who fell with the banner in his hand, by
the only cannon that was fired this morning. The
rest could not bark: Campo-basso had muzzled
Colvin's mastiffs, or we should many more of us
have been served like poor Rudiger. But Colvin
himself is killed."</p>

<p>"Campo-basso, then, was in your correspondence?"
said Arthur.</p>

<p>"Not in ours&mdash;we scorn such companions&mdash;but
some dealing there was between the Italian and
Duke Ferrand; and having disabled the cannon,
and filled the German gunners soundly drunk, he
came off to our camp with fifteen hundred horse,
and offered to act with us. 'But no, no!' said
my father,&mdash;'traitors come not into our Swiss
host;' and so, though we walked in at the door
which he left open, we would not have his company.
So he marched with Duke Ferrand to
attack the other extremity of the camp, where he
found them entrance by announcing them as the
return of a reconnoitring party."</p>

<p>"Nay, then," said Arthur, "a more accomplished
traitor never drew breath, nor one who drew his
net with such success."</p>

<p>"You say well," answered the young Swiss.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span></p>

<p>"The Duke will never, they say, be able to collect
another army?"</p>

<p>"Never, young man," said the Earl of Oxford,
"for he lies dead before you."<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
</p>

<p>Sigismund started; for he had an inherent respect,
and somewhat of fear, for the lofty name of
Charles the Bold, and could hardly believe that the
mangled corpse which now lay before him was once
the personage he had been taught to dread. But his
surprise was mingled with sorrow when he saw the
body of his uncle, Count Albert of Geierstein.</p>

<p>"Oh, my uncle!" he said&mdash;"my dear uncle
Albert! has all your greatness and your wisdom
brought you to a death, at the side of a ditch, like
any crazed beggar?&mdash;Come, this sad news must be
presently told to my father, who will be concerned
to hear of his brother's death, which will add gall
to bitterness, coming on the back of poor Rudiger's.
It is some comfort, however, that father and uncle
never could abide each other."</p>

<p>With some difficulty they once more assisted the
Earl of Oxford to horseback, and were proceeding
to set forward, when the English lord said,&mdash;"You
will place a guard here, to save these bodies
from further dishonour, that they may be interred
with due solemnity."</p>

<p>"By Our Lady of Einsiedlen! I thank you for
the hint," said Sigismund. "Yes, we should do
all that the Church can for uncle Albert. It is to
be hoped he has not gambled away his soul beforehand,
playing with Satan at odds and evens. I
would we had a priest to stay by his poor body;
but it matters not, since no one ever heard of a
demon appearing just before breakfast."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span></p>

<p>They proceeded to the Landamman's quarters,
through sights and scenes which Arthur, and even
his father, so well accustomed to war in all its
shapes, could not look upon without shuddering.
But the simple Sigismund, as he walked by
Arthur's side, contrived to hit upon a theme so
interesting as to divert his sense of the horrors
around them.</p>

<p>"Have you further business in Burgundy, now
this Duke of yours is at an end?"</p>

<p>"My father knows best," said Arthur; "but I
apprehend we have none. The Duchess of Burgundy,
who must now succeed to some sort of
authority in her late husband's dominion, is sister
to this Edward of York, and a mortal enemy to
the House of Lancaster, and to those who have
stood by it faithfully. It were neither prudent
nor safe to tarry where she has influence."</p>

<p>"In that case," said Sigismund, "my plan will
fadge bravely. You shall go back to Geierstein,
and take up your dwelling with us. Your father
will be a brother to mine, and a better one than
uncle Albert, whom he seldom saw or spoke with;
while with your father he will converse from
morning till night, and leave us all the work of
the farm. And you, Arthur, you shall go with
us, and be a brother to us all, in place of poor
Rudiger, who was, to be sure, my real brother,
which you cannot be: nevertheless, I did not like
him so well, in respect he was not so good-natured.
And then Anne&mdash;cousin Anne&mdash;is left all to my
father's charge, and is now at Geierstein&mdash;and
you know, King Arthur, we used to call her Queen
Guenover."</p>

<p>"You spoke great folly then," said Arthur.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span></p>

<p>"But it is great truth&mdash;For, look you, I loved
to tell Anne tales of our hunting, and so forth, but
she would not listen a word till I threw in something
of King Arthur, and then I warrant she
would sit still as a heath-hen when the hawk is
in the heavens. And now Donnerhugel is slain,
you know you may marry my cousin when you
and she will, for nobody hath interest to prevent
it."</p>

<p>Arthur blushed with pleasure under his helmet,
and almost forgave that new-year's morning all
its complicated distresses.</p>

<p>"You forget," he replied to Sigismund, with as
much indifference as he could assume, "that I
may be viewed in your country with prejudice on
account of Rudolph's death."</p>

<p>"Not a whit, not a whit; we bear no malice for
what is done in fair fight under shield. It is no
more than if you had beat him in wrestling or at
quoits&mdash;only it is a game cannot be played over
again."</p>

<p>They now entered the town of Nancy. The
windows were hung with tapestry, and the streets
crowded with tumultuous and rejoicing multitudes,
whom the success of the battle had relieved
from great alarm for the formidable vengeance of
Charles of Burgundy.</p>

<p>The prisoners were received with the utmost
kindness by the Landamman, who assured them of
his protection and friendship. He appeared to
support the death of his son Rudiger with stern
resignation.</p>

<p>"He had rather," he said, "his son fell in battle,
than that he should live to despise the old simplicity
of his country, and think the object of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
combat was the gaining of spoil. The gold of the
dead Burgundy," he added, "would injure the
morals of Switzerland more irretrievably than ever
his sword did their bodies."</p>

<p>He heard of his brother's death without surprise,
but apparently with emotion.</p>

<p>"It was the conclusion," he said, "of a long tissue
of ambitious enterprises, which often offered fair prospects,
but uniformly ended in disappointment."</p>

<p>The Landamman further intimated that his
brother had apprised him that he was engaged in
an affair of so much danger that he was almost
certain to perish in it, and had bequeathed his
daughter to her uncle's care, with instructions
respecting her.</p>

<p>Here they parted for the present, but shortly
after, the Landamman inquired earnestly of the
Earl of Oxford what his motions were like to be,
and whether he could assist them.</p>

<p>"I think of choosing Bretagne for my place of
refuge," answered the Earl, "where my wife has
dwelt since the battle of Tewkesbury expelled us
from England."</p>

<p>"Do not so," said the kind Landamman, "but
come to Geierstein with the countess, where, if she
can, like you, endure our mountain manners and
mountain fare, you are welcome as to the house of
a brother, to a soil where neither conspiracy nor
treason ever flourished. Bethink you, the Duke
of Bretagne is a weak prince, entirely governed
by a wicked favourite, Peter Landais. He is as
capable&mdash;I mean the minister&mdash;of selling brave
men's blood, as a butcher of selling bullock's flesh;
and you know, there are those, both in France and
Burgundy, that thirst after yours."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span></p>

<p>The Earl of Oxford expressed his thanks for the
proposal, and his determination to profit by it, if
approved of by Henry of Lancaster, Earl of Richmond,
whom he now regarded as his sovereign.</p>

<p>To close the tale, about three months after the
battle of Nancy, the banished Earl of Oxford resumed
his name of Philipson, bringing with his
lady some remnants of their former wealth, which
enabled them to procure a commodious residence
near to Geierstein; and the Landamman's interest
in the state procured for them the right of denizenship.
The high blood and the moderate fortunes
of Anne of Geierstein and Arthur de Vere,
joined to their mutual inclination, made their
marriage in every respect rational; and Annette
with her bachelor took up their residence with the
young people, not as servants, but mechanical aids
in the duties of the farm; for Arthur continued to
prefer the chase to the labours of husbandry, which
was of little consequence, as his separate income
amounted, in that poor country, to opulence. Time
glided on, till it amounted to five years since the
exiled family had been inhabitants of Switzerland.
In the year 1482, the Landamman Biederman died
the death of the righteous, lamented universally,
as a model of the true and valiant, simple-minded
and sagacious chiefs who ruled the ancient Switzers
in peace, and headed them in battle. In the same
year, the Earl of Oxford lost his noble countess.</p>

<p>But the star of Lancaster, at that period, began
again to culminate, and called the banished lord
and his son from their retirement, to mix once
more in politics. The treasured necklace of Margaret
was then put to its destined use, and the
produce applied to levy those bands which shortly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
after fought the celebrated battle of Bosworth, in
which the arms of Oxford and his son contributed
so much to the success of Henry VII. This
changed the destinies of De Vere and his lady.
Their Swiss farm was conferred on Annette and
her husband; and the manners and beauty of Anne
of Geierstein attracted as much admiration at the
English court as formerly in the Swiss chalet.

<h2>AUTHOR'S NOTES.</h2>

<p class="center"><a name="Note_I" id="Note_I"></a><a href="#Page_201">Note I. p. 201</a>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Troubadours.</span></p>

<p>The smoothness of the Provençal dialect, partaking strongly
of the Latin, which had been spoken for so many ages in what
was called for distinction's sake the Roman Province of Gaul,
and the richness and fertility of a country abounding in all
that could delight the senses and soothe the imagination, naturally
disposed the inhabitants to cultivate the art of poetry,
and to value and foster the genius of those who distinguished
themselves by attaining excellence in it. Troubadours, that is,
<i>finders</i> or <i>inventors</i>, equivalent to the northern term of <i>makers</i>,
arose in every class, from the lowest to the highest, and success
in their art dignified men of the meanest rank, and added fresh
honours to those who were born in the patrician file of society.
War and love, more especially the latter, were dictated to
them by the chivalry of the times as the especial subjects of
their verse. Such, too, were the themes of our northern minstrels.
But whilst the latter confined themselves in general
to those well-known metrical histories in which scenes of
strife and combat mingled with adventures of enchantment,
and fables of giants and monsters subdued by valiant champions,
such as best attracted the ears of the somewhat duller
and more barbarous warriors of northern France, of Britain,
and of Germany&mdash;the more lively Troubadours produced
poems which turned on human passion, and on love, affection,
and dutiful observance, with which the faithful knight was
bound to regard the object of his choice, and the honour and
respect with which she was bound to recompense his faithful
services.</p>

<p>Thus far it cannot be disputed that the themes selected by
the Troubadours were those on which poetry is most naturally
exerted, and with the best chance of rising to excellence. But
it usually happens, that when any one of the fine arts is cultivated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
exclusively, the taste of those who practise and admire
its productions loses sight of nature, simplicity, and true
taste, and the artist endeavours to discover, while the public
learn to admire, some more complicated system, in which
pedantry supersedes the dictates of natural feeling, and metaphysical
ingenuity is used instead of the more obvious qualifications
of simplicity and good sense. Thus, with the unanimous
approbation of their hearers, the Troubadours framed for
themselves a species of poetry describing and inculcating a
system of metaphysical affection as inconsistent with nature as
the minstrel's tales of magicians and monsters; with this evil
to society, that it was calculated deeply to injure its manners
and its morals. Every Troubadour, or good Knight, who took
the maxims of their poetical school for his rule, was bound to
choose a lady love, the fairest and noblest to whom he had
access, to whom he dedicated at once his lyre and his sword,
and who, married or single, was to be the object to whom his
life, words, and actions were to be devoted. On the other
hand, a lady thus honoured and distinguished was bound, by
accepting the services of such a gallant, to consider him as her
lover, and on all due occasions to grace him as such with distinguished
marks of personal favour. It is true that, according
to the best authorities, the intercourse betwixt her lover and
herself was to be entirely of a Platonic character, and the loyal
swain was not to require, or the chosen lady to grant, anything
beyond the favour she might in strict modesty bestow. Even
under this restriction, the system was like to make wild work
with the domestic peace of families, since it permitted, or
rather enjoined, such familiarity betwixt the fair dame and
her poetical admirer; and very frequently human passions,
placed in such a dangerous situation, proved too strong to
be confined within the metaphysical bounds prescribed to
them by so fantastic and perilous a system. The injured
husbands on many occasions avenged themselves with severity,
and even with dreadful cruelty, on the unfaithful ladies,
and the musical skill and chivalrous character of the lover
proved no protection to his person. But the real spirit of
the system was seen in this, that in the poems of the other
Troubadours, by whom such events are recorded, their pity
is all bestowed on the hapless lovers, while, without the least
allowance for just provocation, the injured husband is held up
to execration.

<p class="center p2"><a name="Note_II" id="Note_II"></a><a href="#Page_203">Note II. p. 203</a>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">High and Noble Parliament of
Love.</span></p>

<p>In Provence, during the flourishing time of the Troubadours,
Love was esteemed so grave and formal a part of the business
of life, that a Parliament or High Court of Love was appointed
for deciding such questions. This singular tribunal was, it
may be supposed, conversant with more of imaginary than
of real suits; but it is astonishing with what cold and pedantic
ingenuity the Troubadours of whom it consisted set themselves
to plead and to decide, upon reasoning which was not
less singular and able than out of place, the absurd questions
which their own fantastic imaginations had previously devised.
There, for example, is a reported case of much celebrity, where
a lady sitting in company with three persons, who were her
admirers, listened to one with the most favourable smiles,
while she pressed the hand of the second, and touched with
her own the foot of the third. It was a case much agitated
and keenly contested in the Parliament of Love, which of
these rivals had received the distinguishing mark of the lady's
favour. Much ingenuity was wasted on this and similar cases,
of which there is a collection, in all judicial form of legal proceedings,
under the title of <i>Arrêts d'Amour</i> (Adjudged Cases
of the Court of Love).</p>

<p class="center p2"><a name="Note_III" id="Note_III"></a><a href="#Page_344">Note III. p. 344</a>.</p>

<p>The following very striking passage is that in which Philip
de Commines sums up the last scene of Charles the Bold,
whose various fortunes he had long watched with a dark anticipation
that a character so reckless, and capable of such excess,
must sooner or later lead to a tragical result:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"As soon as the Count de Campo-basso arrived in the Duke of
Lorrain's army, word was sent him to leave the camp immediately,
for they would not entertain, nor have any communication with,
such traytors. Upon which message he retir'd with his party to a
Castle and Pass not far off, where he fortified himself with carts
and other things as well as he could, in hopes, that if the Duke of
Burgundy was routed, he might have an opportunity of coming in
for a share of the plunder, as he did afterwards. Nor was this
practice with the Duke of Lorrain the most execrable action that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
Campo-basso was guilty of; but before he left the army he conspir'd
with several other officers (finding it was impracticable to attempt
anything against the Duke of Burgundy's person) to leave him
just as they came to charge, for at that time he suppos'd it would
put the Duke into the greatest terror and consternation, and if he
fled, he was sure he could not escape alive, for he had order'd thirteen
or fourteen sure men, some to run as soon as the Germans
came up to charge 'em, and others to watch the Duke of Burgundy,
and kill him in the rout, which was well enough contrived; I myself
have seen two or three of those who were employed to kill the
Duke. Having thus settled his conspiracy at home, he went over
to the Duke of Lorrain upon the approach of the German army;
but finding they would not entertain him, he retired to Condé.</p>

<p>"The German army marched forward, and with 'em a considerable
body of French horse, whom the King had given leave to be
present at that action. Several parties lay in ambush not far off,
that if the Duke of Burgundy was routed, they might surprise some
person of quality, or take some considerable booty. By this every
one may see into what a deplorable condition this poor Duke had
brought himself, by his contempt of good counsel. Both armies
being joyn'd, the Duke of Burgundy's forces having been twice
beaten before, and by consequence weak and dispirited, and ill
provided besides, were quickly broken and entirely defeated:
Many sav'd themselves and got off; the rest were either taken or
kill'd; and among 'em the Duke of Burgundy himself was killed
on the spot. One Monsieur Claude of Bausmont, Captain of the
Castle of Dier in Lorrain, kill'd the Duke of Burgundy. Finding
his army routed, he mounted a swift horse, and endeavouring to
swim a little river in order to make his escape, his horse fell with
him, and overset him: The Duke cry'd out for quarter to this
gentleman, who was pursuing him, but he being deaf, and not hearing
him, immediately kill'd and stripp'd him, not knowing who he
was, and left him naked in the ditch, where his body was found
the next day after the battle; which the Duke of Lorrain (to his
eternal honour) buried with great pomp and magnificence in St.
George's Church, in the old town of Nancy, himself and all his
nobility, in deep mourning, attending the corpse to the grave. The
following epitaph was sometime afterwards ingrav'd on his tomb:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">'<i>Carolus hoc busto Burgundæ gloria gentis</i></p>
<p><i>Conditur, Europæ qui fuit ante timor.</i>'</p>
</div></div>

<p>I saw a seal ring of his, since his death, at Milan, with his arms
cut curiously upon a sardonix that I have seen him often wear in a
ribbon at his breast, which was sold at Milan for two ducats, and
had been stolen from him by a rascal that waited on him in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
chamber. I have often seen the Duke dress'd and undress'd in
great state and formality, and attended by very great persons; but at
his death all this pomp and magnificence ceas'd, and his family was
involv'd in the same ruin with himself, and very likely as a punishment
for his having deliver'd up the Constable not long before, out
of a base and avaricious principle; but God forgive him. I have
known him a powerful and honourable Prince, in as great esteem,
and as much courted by his neighbours (when his affairs were in a
prosperous condition), as any Prince in Europe, and perhaps more;
and I cannot conceive what should provoke God Almighty's displeasure
so highly against him, unless it was his self-love and arrogance,
in appropriating all the success of his enterprises, and all the
renown he ever acquir'd, to his own wisdom and conduct, without
attributing anything to God. Yet to speak truth, he was master
of several good qualities: No Prince ever had a greater ambition
to entertain young noblemen than he, nor was more careful of
their education: His presents and bounty were never profuse and
extravagant, because he gave to many, and had a mind everybody
should taste of it. No Prince was ever more easie of access to
his servants and subjects. Whilst I was in his service he was
never cruel, but a little before his death he took up that humour,
which was an infallible sign of the shortness of his life. He was
very splendid and curious in his dress, and in everything else, and
indeed a little too much. He paid great honours to all ambassadors
and foreigners, and entertain'd them nobly: His ambitious desire
of fame was insatiable, and it was that which induced him to be
eternally in wars, more than any other motive. He ambitiously
desir'd to imitate the old Kings and Heroes of antiquity, whose
actions still shine in History, and are so much talked of in the
world, and his courage was equal to any Prince's of his time.</p>

<p>"But all his designs and imaginations were vain and extravagant,
and turn'd afterwards to his own dishonour and confusion,
for 'tis the conquerors and not the conquer'd that purchase to
themselves renown. I cannot easily determine towards whom God
Almighty shew'd his anger most, whether towards him who died
suddenly without pain or sickness in the field of battle, or towards
his subjects who never enjoy'd peace after his death, but were
continually involv'd in wars, against which they were not able to
maintain themselves, upon account of the civil dissentions and
cruel animosities that arose among 'em; and that which was the
most insupportable, was, that the very people, to whom they were
now oblig'd for their defence and preservation, were the Germans,
who were strangers, and not long since their profess'd enemies. In
short, after the Duke's death, there was not a neighbouring state
that wished them to prosper, nor even Germany that defended 'em.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
And by the management of their affairs, their understanding seem'd
to be as much infatuated as their master's, for they rejected all
good counsel, and pursued such methods as directly tended to
their destruction; and they are still in such a condition, that
though they have at present some little ease and relaxation from
their sorrows, yet 'tis with great danger of a relapse, and 'tis well if
it turns not in the end to their utter ruin.</p>

<p>"I am partly of their opinion who maintain, that God gives
Princes, as he in his wisdom thinks fit, to punish or chastise the
subjects; and he disposes the affection of subjects to their Princes,
as he has determin'd to raise or depress 'em. Just so it has pleas'd
him to deal with the House of Burgundy; for, after a long series of
riches and prosperity, and six-and-twenty years' peace under three
Illustrious Princes, predecessors to this Charles (all of 'em excellent
persons, and of great prudence and discretion), it pleas'd God to
send this Duke Charles, who involv'd them in bloody wars, as well
winter as summer, to their great affliction and expense, in which
most of their richest and stoutest men were either kill'd, or utterly
undone. Their misfortunes continu'd successively to the very hour
of his death; and after such a manner, that at the last, the whole
strength of their country was destroy'd, and all kill'd or taken
prisoners who had any zeal or affection for the House of Burgundy,
and had power to defend the state and dignity of that family; so
that in a manner their losses were equal to, if not over balanc'd
their former prosperity; for as I have seen those Princes heretofore
puissant, rich, and honourable, so it fared the same with their subjects;
for I think, I have seen and known the greatest part of
Europe; yet I never knew any province, or country, tho' perhaps
of a larger extent, so abounding in money, so extravagantly fine in
furniture for their horses, so sumptuous in their buildings, so profuse
in their expenses, so luxurious in their feasts and entertainments,
and so prodigal in all respects, as the subjects of these
Princes, in my time: but it has pleased God at one blow to subvert
and ruin this illustrious family. Such changes and revolutions in
states and kingdoms God in his providence has wrought before we
were born, and will do again when we are in our graves; for this
is a certain maxim, that the prosperity or adversity of Princes are
wholly at his disposal."</p>

<p>(<a name="ednote_a" id="ednote_a" href="#enanchor_a"><i>a</i></a>) p. 114. "The good King René." There is a biography
of this prince, by the Comte de Villeneuve Bargemont. René
of Anjou, descended from the second son of John of Valois,
King of France, inherited the duchy of Lorraine in right of
his wife, daughter of Charles II., Duke of Lorraine. His
claim was contested by Antoine, Comte de Vaudémont, representing
a collateral male branch of the earlier line. This
claimant was backed by Philip the Good, of Burgundy. René
was defeated, in 1431, at Bulgueville, and passed some years
as a captive in Dijon. Here, like Charles d'Orleans in England,
and James I. in the same country, he amused himself
with poetry and art. He succeeded to the crown of Provence,
a remnant of the Neapolitan domains of Anjou, and his
daughter, Yolande, married the son of his rival of Vaudémont.
Lorraine was entailed on them and their issue, failing
male issue of René. After an expedition to Naples he ceded
Lorraine to his son, and passed his time in a pleasing pastoral
manner, in Provence. In his old age Lorraine fell to his
grandson René, and the unlucky region was drawn into
disputes of France and Burgundy, between which it lay. Burgundy
conquered Lorraine. Old René negotiated for Burgundian
protection, and for Charles's succession to Provence,
which on René's death would make Burgundy "a Middle
Kingdom conterminous with Germany and France." But the
conquest of Lorraine was the last of Charles's successes: the
end of the novel before us tells the story of his fall.</p>

<p>(<a name="ednote_b" id="ednote_b" href="#enanchor_b"><i>b</i></a>) p. 116. "Edward of York has crossed the Sea." The
date is 1475. Louis and Edward met on the bridge over the
Somme, at Pequigny, and made terms. The scheme of
Oxford, in the novel, for an invasion of England during
Edward's absence, was thus rendered impossible.</p>

<p>(<a name="ednote_c" id="ednote_c" href="#enanchor_c"><i>c</i></a>) p. 125. "Henry Colvin." Comines calls this soldier
"Cohin," in the oldest texts "Colpin." He commanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
three hundred English, and was killed by a cannon shot:
"great loss to the Duke, for a single man may save his master,
though he be of no great lineage, so he have but sense and
virtue."</p>

<p>(<a name="ednote_d" id="ednote_d" href="#enanchor_d"><i>d</i></a>) p. 262. "Granson." The Burgundian defeat is described
in Comines, book v. ch. i. Of Charles, Comines says, "il
perdit honneur et chevance ce jour." Morat he describes in
book v. ch. iii. The narrative of Charles's despair, and the
detail of his drinking <i>tisane</i> in place of wine, is borrowed
from Comines, book v. ch. v., in the sixteenth chapter of
the novel. The treachery of Campobasso is recorded in
Comines's sixth-ninth chapter. Mr. Kirk's version of
Charles's last fight is written with much spirit.</p>

 The word Wehme, pronounced Vehme, is of uncertain derivation,
but was always used to intimate this inquisitorial and secret
Court. The members were termed Wissenden, or Initiated,
answering to the modern phrase of Illuminati. Mr. Palgrave
seems inclined to derive the word <i>Vehme</i> from <i>Ehme</i>, <i>i.e.</i> <i>Law</i>, and
he is probably right.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>

 The parts of Germany subjected to the operation of the Secret
Tribunal were called, from the blood which it spilt, or from some
other reason (Mr. Palgrave suggests the ground tincture of the
ancient banner of the district), the Red Soil. Westphalia, as the
limits of that country were understood in the Middle Ages, which
are considerably different from the present boundaries, was the
principal theatre of the Vehme.</p>

 The Archbishop of Cologne was recognised as head of all the
Free Tribunals (<i>i.e.</i> the Vehmique benches) in Westphalia, by a
writ of privilege granted in 1335 by the Emperor Charles IV.
Winceslaus confirmed this act by a privilege dated 1382, in which
the Archbishop is termed Grand Master of the Vehme, or Grand
Inquisitor. And this prelate and other priests were encouraged to
exercise such office by Pope Boniface III., whose ecclesiastical discipline
permitted them in such cases to assume the right of judging
in matters of life and death.</p>
